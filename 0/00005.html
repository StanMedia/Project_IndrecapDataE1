They are also one of the few vertebrates that reproduce asexually, meaning they produce offspring without mating. All individuals are female and genetically identical to their mothers.</p><p>These lizards inhabit grassland habitats that are frequently disturbed by noise pollution from US Army aircraft. The lizard's range overlaps with the Fort Carson Military Base in Colorado Springs, which covers 212 square miles (550 square km) and hosts fighter jets, transport planes, and helicopters.</p><h2>Stress response</h2><p>A team of researchers from Utah State University and Fort Carson conducted a study to investigate how noise affects the physiology and behavior of these lizards. They collected blood samples from 32 lizards at four sites with different levels of noise exposure and measured their stress hormones, glucose, and lactate.</p><p>They also observed the lizards' activity and foraging behavior using radio telemetry and video cameras. They recorded the number and duration of aircraft flyovers at each site using sound meters.</p><p>The results, published in the journal Frontiers in Amphibian and Reptile Science, showed that lizards living in noisier areas had higher levels of stress hormones and glucose than those in quieter areas. This indicates that noise triggers a metabolic response that consumes energy.</p><h2>Coping strategy</h2><p>To compensate for the energy loss, the lizards adopted a coping strategy: they moved less and ate more. The researchers found that lizards in noisier sites spent more time foraging and less time basking or hiding than those in quieter sites. They also ate more insects per hour during noisy flyovers than during quiet periods.</p><p>By snacking during stressful sounds, the lizards may be replenishing their energy reserves and reducing their exposure to predators, the researchers suggested. However, this strategy may also have negative consequences, such as increased risk of parasitism, obesity, or predation.</p><h2>Implications for conservation</h2><p>The study is one of the first to examine the effects of noise pollution on lizards, which are often overlooked in ecological research. The findings have implications for the conservation of this rare and endemic species, as well as other wildlife that share its habitat.</p><p>"Noise pollution is a pervasive and growing threat to biodiversity worldwide," co-lead study author Carina Kusaka, a doctoral student at Utah State University, said in a statement. "Our study provides novel insights into how noise affects the physiology and behavior of a reptile species that is of conservation concern."</p><p>The researchers hope that their study will inform management decisions and mitigation measures to reduce noise impacts on wildlife. They also plan to conduct further research on how noise affects other aspects of lizard biology, such as reproduction, growth, and survival.</p><h6>Colorado checkered whiptail, noise pollution, US Army aircraft</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
