It covers spending that Congress has already authorized, such as Social Security benefits, military salaries, interest payments to creditors, and other obligations.</p><p>If the debt ceiling is not raised, the Treasury Department would run out of money and would not be able to pay all of its bills on time. This could trigger a default, which means the US would fail to honor its financial commitments to its lenders, such as China, Japan, and other countries that hold US Treasury bonds.</p><p>A default would have serious consequences for the US and the global economy. It could cause interest rates to spike, stock markets to plunge, credit ratings to downgrade, and confidence to erode. It could also disrupt vital services and programs that millions of Americans rely on.</p><h2>How did the deal come about?</h2><p>The debt ceiling has been a source of political drama and brinkmanship for years. Congress has raised or suspended it 78 times since 1960, often at the last minute and after intense negotiations.</p><p>The current debt ceiling was reinstated in August 2021 at $28.4 trillion, after being suspended for two years. Since then, the Treasury Department has been using extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but warned that those measures would run out by early June 2023.</p><p>President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress wanted to raise or suspend the debt ceiling without any conditions, arguing that it was a bipartisan responsibility to pay for past spending. They also wanted to use a fast-track process known as reconciliation to pass their $3.5 trillion social spending plan without Republican support.</p><p>However, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his Republican colleagues refused to cooperate on raising the debt ceiling, saying that Democrats should do it on their own through reconciliation. They also opposed Biden's spending plan, calling it a wasteful and inflationary agenda that would hurt the economy.</p><p>The standoff between the two parties lasted for months, creating uncertainty and anxiety in the financial markets and among the public. As the deadline approached, both sides faced increasing pressure to find a solution and avoid a default.</p><p>On Saturday, May 27, 2023, Biden and McCarthy announced that they had reached a tentative agreement to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, enough to cover the government's borrowing needs until December 2024. The deal also included some provisions to address Republican concerns about fiscal responsibility, such as requiring regular reports on the national debt and creating a bipartisan commission to study budget reforms.</p><p>The deal was welcomed by both parties as a compromise that would prevent a crisis and allow them to focus on other priorities. However, it still faced some challenges before becoming law. It needed to be approved by both chambers of Congress and signed by Biden before June 2, 2023, when the Treasury Department estimated it would exhaust its extraordinary measures.</p><h2>What are the challenges and implications of the deal?</h2><p>The deal was not without controversy and criticism from some lawmakers and groups on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Some House conservatives denounced the deal as a betrayal of their principles and vowed to vote against it. They argued that raising the debt ceiling would enable more spending and borrowing by Democrats and worsen the fiscal situation of the country. They also accused McCarthy of caving in to Biden's demands and giving up leverage in future negotiations.</p><p>Some House progressives also expressed dissatisfaction with the deal, saying that it did not address their demands for more social spending and climate action. They complained that they had been sidelined by their party leaders and pressured to accept a deal that they had no input in. They also threatened to withhold their support for a separate bipartisan infrastructure bill unless their priorities were met.</p><p>Despite these dissenting voices, most lawmakers from both parties signaled their support for the deal, recognizing that it was better than risking a default. The deal passed the House on Monday, May 29, 2023, by a vote of 285-145, with 50 Republicans joining 235 Democrats in favor. The Senate followed suit on Tuesday, May 30, 2023, by a vote of 67-33, with 17 Republicans joining 50 Democrats in favor. Biden signed the bill into law on Wednesday, May 31, 2023.</p><p>The deal was hailed by Biden and McCarthy as a victory for bipartisanship and pragmatism. They said that they had shown the American people and the world that they could work together to solve problems and protect the full faith and credit of the United States. They also said that they hoped to build on this momentum and cooperate on other issues of common interest.</p><p>However, the deal was also seen by some analysts and observers as a temporary fix that did not address the underlying causes of the debt ceiling drama. They pointed out that the deal did not reduce the debt or the deficit, but merely postponed the next showdown until after the 2024 presidential election. They also noted that the deal did not resolve the partisan divide over spending and taxation, which could resurface in future debates.</p><h6>US debt ceiling, debt limit, default, Biden, McCarthy, deal</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
