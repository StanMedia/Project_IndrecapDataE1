Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada told the Japanese military on Saturday to make the "necessary preparations," as he could potentially "order the destruction of ballistic missiles."</p><p>The news follows an announcement by North Korea on Wednesday that Pyongyang is making its final preparations to launch its first military reconnaissance satellite. In a statement released by the Ministry of Defense, Hamada did not rule out shooting down the rocket used to launch the satellite.</p><p>The Japanese Self Defense Forces have been put on alert for any debris from the rocket falling into Japanese territory. The Japanese military will deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor missiles and Aegis-equipped destroyer warships carrying sea-based Standard Missile-3 interceptor projectiles, the statement added.</p><p>Japan has a two-tier missile defense system consisting of the PAC-3 and SM-3 interceptors. The PAC-3 is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, while the SM-3 is capable of destroying longer-range missiles in their midcourse phase.</p><p>Japan has been upgrading its missile defense capabilities in recent years, amid growing threats from North Korea and China. In 2019, Japan decided to purchase two Aegis Ashore land-based missile defense systems from the United States, but later scrapped the plan due to technical and cost issues. Japan is now considering alternative options, such as deploying more Aegis ships or developing new interceptor missiles.</p><h2>North Korea's spy satellite ambitions</h2><p>North Korean state media KCNA reported on Wednesday that its leader Kim Jong Un had ordered officials to prepare to launch the country's first military reconnaissance satellite. Kim made the remarks alongside his daughter, believed to be called Ju Ae, who has increasingly accompanied her father on public outings, during a visit to the National Aerospace Development Administration earlier this week.</p><p>North Korea claimed as early as last December that it had conducted an "important final stage test" for the development of a spy satellite. It has previously said the satellite could be ready by as soon as April this year.</p><p>North Korea has launched several satellites in the past, but none of them have been confirmed to be operational or capable of transmitting images or data. The United States and its allies have condemned North Korea's satellite launches as disguised tests of ballistic missile technology, which are banned by UN Security Council resolutions.</p><p>North Korea is believed to possess a range of ballistic missiles that can reach Japan and South Korea, as well as some parts of the United States. In 2017, North Korea tested its most powerful nuclear weapon and launched three intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could potentially strike anywhere in the United States.</p><p>However, since 2018, North Korea has refrained from conducting any nuclear or long-range missile tests, following a series of diplomatic engagements with South Korea and the United States. The talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula have stalled since 2019, after a failed summit between Kim and former US President Donald Trump in Hanoi.</p><p>The current US administration under President Joe Biden has said it is open to dialogue with North Korea, but has also vowed to maintain pressure and sanctions until Pyongyang takes concrete steps toward denuclearization. North Korea has rejected any preconditions for talks and demanded that the United States drop its "hostile policy" toward it.</p><h6>Japan, North Korea, spy satellite, missile defense</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
