The news release described the big cat as "a beautiful lioness, in her prime and clearly in great health."</p><p>Lions are considered extinct in Sena Oura, located near Chad's border with Cameroon, by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The park is part of a transboundary protected area that spans both countries and covers more than 30,000 square kilometers.</p><p>The region "saw a period of ruthless, organized poaching more than a decade ago, but has since benefited from a very strong commitment to conservation by the governments of both Cameroon and Chad," the WCS said in the news release.</p><p>"This has produced better protection of the national parks and wildlife populations are now starting to recover," it added.</p><h2>Lions are under threat across Africa, especially in west and central regions</h2><p>Lions are one of the most iconic and charismatic animals in Africa, but they are also facing serious threats from human activities. The IUCN categorizes lions as "Vulnerable" on its Red List of Threatened Species, with between 23,000 and 39,000 of the big cats left in the wild.</p><p>Their populations have declined by about 43% over the past two decades, according to the IUCN. Their range has also shrunk by more than 90% compared to historical levels. Lions have disappeared from 26 African countries and are extinct in Asia.</p><p>The main causes of their decline are habitat loss and fragmentation, depletion of their prey base, and conflict with humans. Lions are often killed by livestock owners who perceive them as a threat to their animals or livelihoods. They are also targeted by poachers who trade their body parts, such as bones, teeth, and claws, for traditional medicine or trophies.</p><p>Lions are particularly vulnerable in west and central Africa, where their populations are small and isolated. According to the WCS, there are fewer than 2,000 lions left in these regions, representing less than 10% of the global population.</p><p>The WCS and its partners have been working to conserve lions and other wildlife in Sena Oura and other protected areas in Chad and Cameroon. They have supported anti-poaching patrols, community engagement, wildlife monitoring, and transboundary cooperation.</p><p>The WCS said that the sighting of the lioness in Sena Oura is "a sign of hope for the future of lions in this region."</p><p>"It also highlights the importance of continued conservation efforts to secure these landscapes for wildlife and people," it said.</p><h6>lion, Sena Oura National Park, Chad, Cameroon, Wildlife Conservation Society</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
