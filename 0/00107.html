He said he hoped to meet with the Biden administration and lawmakers to discuss the situation in his country and the region.</p><p>"We also hope to meet with the Biden administration -- obviously it's a critical moment for the region, especially Venezuela, a moment in which we are pressing to achieve a free election," he said during a surprise appearance at the Washington Conference on the Americas.</p><p>Guaidó served as the interim president of Venezuela's transitional government from 2019 until late 2022, when he was ousted from his leadership role by a rival faction of the opposition. He had been recognized by more than 50 countries, including the US, as Venezuela's legitimate leader after Maduro's disputed re-election in 2018.</p><p>However, Guaidó failed to dislodge Maduro from power despite several attempts, including a failed uprising in 2019 and a botched incursion in 2020. He also lost support among Venezuelans, who have been suffering from a severe economic and humanitarian crisis under Maduro's rule.</p><p>Guaidó's visit to Washington comes after he caused a stir last week when he showed up in Colombia for a summit organized by Colombian President Gustavo Petro in Bogotá, which aimed to restart talks with the Venezuelan government and the opposition.</p><p>Guaidó said at the time that Colombian Foreign Minister Álvaro Leyva had invited him to attend the summit -- which Leyva denied, saying instead that the opposition figure had entered Colombia inappropriately.</p><p>Guaidó landed in Miami the following day, after accusing Colombia of forcing him out of the country -- a claim Colombian officials refuted.</p><h2>The context</h2><p>Guaidó's visit to Washington comes amid a changing political landscape in Latin America and a shifting US policy toward Venezuela.</p><p>In recent months, several countries in the region have elected left-wing or populist leaders who are more sympathetic to Maduro or less confrontational with him. These include Peru, Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Colombia, one of Venezuela's staunchest critics and allies of the US, is also facing social unrest and political uncertainty ahead of its presidential election next year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Biden administration has somewhat softened its stance toward Caracas as it seeks to balance its pressure on Maduro with its humanitarian concerns for Venezuelans. The US has loosened some sanctions against the Maduro government in 2022, and last November, it granted Chevron limited authorization to resume pumping oil from Venezuela.</p><p>The US has also expressed its willingness to engage in dialogue with Maduro's representatives, while maintaining its recognition of Guaidó as Venezuela's interim president. However, it has not appointed a special envoy for Venezuela or lifted its support for sanctions against Maduro and his allies.</p><p>The US has also been concerned about Russia's presence and influence in Latin America, especially in Venezuela. Guaidó reiterated his warning on Tuesday: "Two weeks ago, Maduro welcomes (Russian Foreign Minister Sergey) Lavrov with open arms, and you know very well what that represents, and how (Lavrov) intend to destabilize the region."</p><p>Venezuela is due to hold a presidential election in 2024, but there is little hope that it will be free and fair under Maduro's control. The opposition remains divided and weakened, while Maduro enjoys the backing of the military and key allies such as Cuba, China and Iran.</p><p>Venezuela is also facing a deepening humanitarian crisis, with millions of people suffering from food insecurity, hyperinflation, power outages and lack of basic services. More than 5 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, creating one of the largest refugee crises in the world.</p><h2>The stalemate</h2><p>The Venezuelan government and opposition have been locked in a protracted political crisis since 2019, when Juan Guaidó, then the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president and challenged the legitimacy of Nicolás Maduro, who had been re-elected in a widely disputed vote in 2018.</p><p>Guaidó was recognized by more than 50 countries, including the US and many Latin American and European nations, as Venezuela's rightful leader. He also received support from millions of Venezuelans who took to the streets to demand Maduro's exit.</p><p>Maduro, however, refused to step down and retained the backing of the military, the judiciary, the electoral body and key allies such as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran. He also cracked down on dissent and accused Guaidó and his supporters of being part of a US-led coup attempt.</p><p>The political standoff has exacerbated Venezuela's economic and humanitarian crisis, which has been worsened by US sanctions, hyperinflation, corruption, mismanagement and the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 5 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, creating one of the largest refugee crises in the world.</p><p>Several attempts to resolve the crisis through dialogue have failed in the past, mainly due to a lack of trust and willingness to compromise between the two sides. The most recent round of talks, mediated by Norway in Barbados in 2019, collapsed after Maduro withdrew from the negotiations following a new round of US sanctions.</p><h2>The talks</h2><p>In July 2021, Reuters reported that representatives of the Venezuelan government and opposition were set to meet in Mexico beginning in August for a new round of negotiations aimed at ending the political impasse.</p><p>The talks would be facilitated by Norway, which has a track record of mediating in conflicts around the world. They would also involve international observers from countries such as Russia, Canada, France and the Netherlands.</p><p>The agenda of the talks has not been officially disclosed, but sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that it would include issues such as electoral conditions, political prisoners, sanctions relief and humanitarian aid.</p><p>The talks would mark a shift in strategy for both sides, who have been facing increasing pressure to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.</p><p>For Maduro, the talks could offer a chance to ease the economic hardship caused by US sanctions and gain some legitimacy in the international arena. He has also expressed his willingness to hold early presidential elections under certain conditions.</p><p>For Guaidó, the talks could offer a way to regain momentum and relevance after losing his leadership role within the opposition and his recognition as interim president by some countries. He has also faced criticism for his involvement in a failed incursion in 2020 and his lack of concrete results.</p><p>However, the talks also face many challenges and uncertainties. Some of them include:</p><ul><li>The level of representation and commitment of both sides. Maduro has said he would not attend the talks personally and would delegate his vice president and other officials. Guaidó has said he would lead a "unitary delegation" that represents all sectors of the opposition, but some factions have expressed doubts or reservations about his role.</li><li>The role and influence of external actors. The US has said it supports a negotiated solution to the crisis and would consider lifting sanctions if there is significant progress. However, it has also maintained its "maximum pressure" policy on Maduro's regime. Russia has said it supports dialogue without preconditions or interference. However, it has also continued to provide military and economic support to Maduro's regime.</li><li>The expectations and demands of both sides. Maduro has said he wants an end to US sanctions and recognition of his government as a precondition for any agreement. Guaidó has said he wants free and fair presidential elections and respect for human rights as a precondition for any agreement.</li><li>The reaction and participation of civil society. Many Venezuelans are skeptical or disillusioned about the prospects of dialogue after previous failures. Some are also wary of any concessions or compromises that could benefit Maduro or Guaidó at their expense. Others are hopeful that dialogue could bring some relief or change to their dire situation.</li></ul><h2>The challenge</h2><p>Juan Guaidó emerged as the face of Venezuela's opposition in January 2019, when he declared himself interim president and challenged the legitimacy of Nicolás Maduro, who had been re-elected in a widely disputed vote in 2018.</p><p>Guaidó, then the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, invoked articles of the constitution that allow the head of the legislature to assume power in case of a presidential vacancy. He argued that Maduro's re-election was fraudulent and that his term had expired.</p><p>Guaidó was recognized by more than 50 countries, including the US and many Latin American and European nations, as Venezuela's rightful leader. He also received support from millions of Venezuelans who took to the streets to demand Maduro's exit.</p><p>Guaidó vowed to restore democracy and end the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has been suffering from hyperinflation, food shortages, power cuts and lack of basic services under Maduro's rule. More than 5 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, creating one of the largest refugee crises in the world.</p><p>Guaidó also tried to persuade the military, which holds the balance of power in Venezuela, to switch sides and join his cause. He led several attempts to oust Maduro from power, including a failed uprising in April 2019 and a botched incursion in May 2020.</p><h2>The decline</h2><p>However, Guaidó failed to dislodge Maduro from power or achieve any significant concessions from his regime. Maduro retained the backing of the military, the judiciary, the electoral body and key allies such as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran. He also cracked down on dissent and accused Guaidó and his supporters of being part of a US-led coup attempt.</p><p>Guaidó's popularity and influence began to wane as his campaign stalled and Venezuelans grew frustrated with the lack of results. He also faced divisions and defections within the opposition, which accused him of being ineffective, authoritarian or corrupt.</p><p>Guaidó's position was further weakened in December 2020, when Maduro held parliamentary elections that were boycotted by most of the opposition and denounced by many countries as rigged. The elections resulted in a pro-government majority in the National Assembly, which stripped Guaidó of his legal basis to claim the interim presidency.</p><p>Guaidó refused to recognize the new legislature and formed a parallel parliament with his allies. However, some countries that had previously recognized him as interim president withdrew their recognition or adopted a more ambiguous stance. The US maintained its support for Guaidó but also expressed its willingness to engage in dialogue with Maduro's representatives.</p><p>Guaidó's leadership was challenged by another opposition figure, Henrique Capriles, who proposed a more pragmatic approach to negotiate with Maduro and participate in regional elections scheduled for November 2021. Guaidó initially rejected Capriles' proposal but later agreed to form a "unitary platform" with him and other opposition factions.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>Guaidó's future is uncertain as he faces a political stalemate with Maduro and a loss of relevance among Venezuelans and international allies. He still insists that he is the legitimate president and that he will continue to fight for free and fair presidential elections.</p><p>Guaidó is expected to participate in a new round of talks with Maduro's government in Mexico beginning in August 2021. The talks will be facilitated by Norway and involve international observers from countries such as Russia, Canada, France and the Netherlands.</p><p>The agenda of the talks has not been officially disclosed, but sources familiar with the matter said it would include issues such as electoral conditions, political prisoners, sanctions relief and humanitarian aid.</p><p>Guaidó hopes that the talks will lead to a peaceful transition of power and a solution to the crisis. However, he faces many challenges and uncertainties, such as:</p><ul><li>The level of representation and commitment of both sides. Maduro has said he will not attend the talks personally and will delegate his vice president and other officials. Guaidó has said he will lead a "unitary delegation" that represents all sectors of the opposition, but some factions have expressed doubts or reservations about his role.</li><li>The role and influence of external actors.
