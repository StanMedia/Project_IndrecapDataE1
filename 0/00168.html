It was created in 1917 to simplify the process of issuing debt, but it has become a source of political conflict in recent years.</p><p>The US government spends more than it collects in taxes, so it relies on borrowing to cover the gap. The debt ceiling does not authorize new spending, but rather allows the government to pay for what it has already approved.</p><p>If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before the government runs out of cash, the Treasury Department would be unable to pay its bills, including interest on its debt, Social Security benefits, military salaries, and tax refunds. This would amount to a default, or a failure to honor its financial obligations.</p><h2>What would a default mean for the global economy?</h2><p>A default by the US government would be unprecedented and catastrophic for the global economy, which is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and the first major war in Europe since 1945.</p><p>The US dollar is the world's reserve currency, meaning that most countries hold it as part of their foreign exchange reserves and use it for international trade and financial transactions. US Treasury securities are considered the safest and most liquid assets in the world, serving as a benchmark for interest rates and a haven for investors in times of turmoil.</p><p>If the US government fails to pay its creditors on time, it would undermine the credibility and stability of the dollar and Treasuries, causing a sharp rise in borrowing costs, a plunge in asset prices, a flight to other currencies and assets, and a loss of confidence in the US as an economic and political leader.</p><p>The ripple effects would be felt across the globe, as many countries and institutions depend on US financial markets for funding and trade. A default could also trigger a credit rating downgrade for the US, which would increase its future borrowing costs and reduce its fiscal space.</p><p>According to some estimates, a default could wipe out as much as 6% of global GDP and push millions of people into poverty. Danny Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth University and former interest rate-setter at the Bank of England, said the fallout from a default would be "a million" times worse than the 2008 global financial crisis.</p><h2>What are the chances of a default and how can it be avoided?</h2><p>The chances of a default are low but not zero. The US government has never defaulted on its debt before, and most observers expect that Congress will reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling before the deadline.</p><p>However, the political situation in Washington is tense and unpredictable, as Democrats and Republicans are divided over how to address the country's fiscal challenges and other policy issues. The debt ceiling has been used as a bargaining chip in previous negotiations, resulting in brinkmanship and uncertainty that have rattled financial markets.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has urged Congress to act swiftly and decisively to raise or suspend the debt ceiling, warning that even a delay or a near-miss could cause "substantial financial market distress" and damage the economy.</p><p>She has also said that there are no legal or practical options to avoid a default once the government runs out of cash. The Treasury Department has been using extraordinary measures since August 1 to conserve cash, such as suspending investments in pension funds. But these measures will be exhausted by June 5, according to Yellen's latest estimate.</p><p>Some analysts have suggested that President Joe Biden could invoke the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which states that "the validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned." However, this option is legally controversial and politically risky, and Biden has not indicated that he would consider it.</p><p>The only sure way to prevent a default is for Congress to raise or suspend the debt ceiling as soon as possible. This would allow the government to continue borrowing and paying its bills without interruption, preserving its creditworthiness and avoiding another shock to the global economy.</p><h6>US debt crisis, debt ceiling, default, global economy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
