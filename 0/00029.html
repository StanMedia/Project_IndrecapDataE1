Three of the envelopes reached the newsrooms of three separate television channels, while two other envelopes addressed to a radio station and journalist Carlos Vera were intercepted, according to the country's Interior Minister Juan Zapata.</p><p>Zapata said on Monday that this was "an absolutely clear message of silencing journalists who have been strong in their way of being or silencing the media". He condemned the acts and confirmed that an in depth investigation was underway.</p><p>The government also issued a statement saying that it "categorically rejects all types of violent acts perpetrated against journalists or the media" and that it would defend freedom of expression in the country.</p><h2>The explosive devices were hidden in memory sticks and other gadgets</h2><p>The explosive devices were disguised as commonplace electronic devices, such as memory sticks, USB chargers, and power banks. They were sent by mail to various media outlets and journalists in Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador's two largest cities.</p><p>One of the devices partly exploded at Ecuavisa television in Guayaquil when journalist Lenin Artieda plugged a memory stick containing an explosive device into his computer. He suffered minor injuries, according to police. The explosion did not injure anyone else, nor did it cause any material damage to the newsroom.</p><p>The police carried out a controlled detonation of a device sent to the news department of TC Televisión, also in Guayaquil, addressed to journalist Mauricio Ayora. The station said the envelope had not been opened.</p><p>A third envelope containing explosives arrived at the Teleamazonas newsroom in Quito last Thursday, addressed to presenter and executive producer Milton Pérez, but it was not delivered until Monday, Pérez confirmed to CNN. He said he had received an anonymous envelope and upon opening it had discovered a device, which the police confirmed contained explosives.</p><p>Two more envelopes addressed to journalist Miguel Rivadeneira of radio station EXA FM and journalist Carlos Vera were intercepted by a parcel delivery service in Quito and Guayaquil respectively on Monday, according to minister Zapata and Álvaro Rosero, director of EXA FM.</p><h2>The motive behind the attacks is unclear</h2><p>The prosecutor's office said it had opened a terrorism investigation following the various attacks. Evidence has been collected from the media outlets that received envelopes containing the devices, and all of the devices will be included in a single investigation because of the similarities between them, it said in a statement.</p><p>The motive behind the attacks is unclear. None of the journalists or media outlets targeted have reported receiving any threats or warnings prior to receiving the explosive devices. The journalists work for different media outlets with different editorial lines and cover different topics.</p><p>Some analysts have speculated that the attacks could be related to the rising violence in Ecuador, which President Guillermo Lasso has blamed on competition between drug trafficking gangs for territory and control. Ecuador is used as a transit point for cocaine being moved to the United States and Europe.</p><p>Others have suggested that the attacks could be politically motivated, as Ecuador is going through a period of social unrest and economic crisis. Lasso, who took office in May 2021, has faced protests and criticism over his austerity measures and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The attacks have sparked outrage and solidarity among journalists and media organizations in Ecuador and abroad. Fundamedios, a regional freedom of expression advocacy group, said it condemned "these acts of intimidation against journalism" and urged authorities to "investigate these facts with due diligence".</p><h6>Ecuador, journalism, terrorism, explosives</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
