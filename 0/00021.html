Her key campaign promise was to stop migrant boats using Italy as a gateway into Europe. She vowed to implement a "naval blockade" to prevent humanitarian rescue ships from docking in Italian ports and to send back migrants who arrived by sea.</p><p>Meloni's anti-immigration rhetoric resonated with many Italians who felt overwhelmed by the influx of migrants and asylum seekers, especially from Africa and the Middle East. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 77,000 people arrived in Italy by sea in 2021, a fourfold increase from 2020. Many of them were fleeing war, persecution, poverty and climate change in their home countries.</p><p>Meloni blamed the previous governments for being too lenient and ineffective in dealing with the migrant crisis. She also accused the European Union of abandoning Italy and failing to share the burden of hosting and relocating migrants across the bloc. She pledged to renegotiate the EU's migration policy and to demand more solidarity and responsibility from other member states.</p><h2>Meloni's actions and reactions</h2><p>Since taking office, Meloni has taken a series of controversial measures to fulfill her promise. She has deployed more naval and coast guard vessels to patrol the Mediterranean Sea and intercept migrant boats. She has also closed Italian ports to NGO rescue ships, such as Sea-Watch and SOS Mediterranee, which she accused of being "taxi services" for smugglers and traffickers. She has ordered the expulsion of thousands of migrants who arrived by sea or who were irregularly staying in Italy. She has also cut funding for integration programs and reception centers for migrants and asylum seekers.</p><p>Meloni's actions have sparked criticism from human rights groups, who denounced her policies as cruel, inhumane and illegal. They argued that Meloni was violating international law and humanitarian principles by endangering the lives of migrants at sea, denying them access to protection and asylum procedures, and exposing them to abuse and violence in Libya, where many of them are returned. They also warned that Meloni was fueling xenophobia, racism and hate crimes against migrants and minorities in Italy.</p><p>Meloni's policies have also caused tensions with some of Italy's EU partners, especially Germany and France, who urged her to respect human rights and international obligations. They also expressed concern that Meloni was undermining the EU's efforts to find a common solution to the migration challenge, based on solidarity, cooperation and respect for human dignity. They called on Meloni to engage in dialogue and compromise with other EU leaders, rather than pursuing a unilateral and confrontational approach.</p><h2>Meloni's challenges and prospects</h2><p>Meloni faces several challenges in implementing her hardline stance on migration. One of them is the legal challenge from the European Court of Justice, which has opened an infringement procedure against Italy for violating EU law on asylum and migration. The court could impose sanctions on Italy if it does not comply with its rulings.</p><p>Another challenge is the political challenge from within her own coalition, which includes former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia party and Matteo Salvini's far-right League party. Both parties have their own agendas and interests on migration and other issues, such as the economy, health care and foreign policy. Meloni may have to make concessions or face instability and infighting within her government.</p><p>A third challenge is the social challenge from civil society groups, activists, journalists, artists, religious leaders and ordinary citizens who oppose Meloni's policies and values. They have organized protests, campaigns, petitions, lawsuits, investigations and artistic expressions to denounce Meloni's actions and to defend human rights, democracy and diversity in Italy.</p><p>Meloni's prospects depend largely on how she will manage these challenges and how she will respond to the changing realities and dynamics of migration. While she enjoys high popularity ratings among her supporters, she may also face growing discontent and disillusionment among those who expect her to deliver on her promise or who disagree with her vision for Italy.</p><h6>Italy, Giorgia Meloni, migration, EU</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
