The fireball was visible for more than four minutes in broad daylight, indicating that it was a significant event.</p><p>According to NASA's Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Lab, the fireball was caused by a meteoroid — a small piece of space rock — entering Earth's atmosphere at high speed and burning up. The ARES Lab used radar data to calculate the "strewn field" — the area where fragments of the meteoroid might have landed — near Calais, Maine. Some of the fragments may have been carried by winds across the border into Canada.</p><h2>A lucrative reward</h2><p>The Maine Mineral &amp; Gem Museum (MMGM) is offering a $25,000 reward for the first meteorite piece found that weighs 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) or more. However, the museum is also interested in buying any specimen of any size, as long as it can be verified as part of the fireball.</p><p>Darryl Pitt, head of the meteorite division at MMGM, said he was keen to study any fragments of the meteorite, which could contain valuable information about the origins of the solar system. Depending on the type of meteorite, it could have different chemical compositions, mineral structures and magnetic properties.</p><p>"Meteorites are like time capsules from the early solar system. They can tell us about how planets formed and evolved," Pitt said. "They are also very rare and beautiful objects that can be worth more than gold."</p><p>Pitt said that finding meteorites in the woods of Maine is not an easy task, but it is not impossible either. He said that meteorites would look different from the surrounding rocks. The outside would likely be blackened by the heat of entry, while the inside would likely be a different color. It may also contain iron and therefore be attracted to a magnet.</p><h2>A challenge for hunters</h2><p>Pitt said that worldwide, only eight to 10 meteorites are recovered each year out of hundreds of fireballs seen falling to Earth. Most of them fall into the ocean or remote areas where they are unlikely to be found.</p><p>The MMGM offered a reward for a meteorite once before, in 2016, when another fireball lit up the sky over Maine and Canada. However, no one claimed the prize then, as no fragments were recovered.</p><p>This time, Pitt said he was "guardedly optimistic" because there is more detailed information available from radar data, and he expects a "robust response" from meteorite hunters.</p><p>He said that anyone who thinks they have found a piece of the fireball should contact the museum as soon as possible and follow some basic guidelines:</p><ul><li>Do not touch the meteorite with bare hands or metal tools, as it could contaminate or damage it.</li><li>Wrap it in aluminum foil or place it in a clean plastic bag.</li><li>Keep it away from heat, moisture and magnets.</li><li>Record the exact location and time of finding it.</li></ul><p>Pitt said that the museum will provide free authentication and appraisal services for any potential meteorite finders. He also said that the museum will display any acquired specimens for public education and enjoyment.</p><p>"This is a rare opportunity for anyone who loves space and science to find and own a piece of a fireball," Pitt said. "We hope that this reward will inspire people to go out and explore nature and maybe make history."</p><h2>What fragments of meteorites can tell us about the past</h2><p>Fragments of meteorites from the past can provide important messages about the history and evolution of our solar system and our planet. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>Meteorites can tell us about the age and composition of different celestial bodies, such as asteroids, planets, moons and comets. By analyzing the chemical and isotopic signatures of meteorites, scientists can determine where and when they formed and how they changed over time. For instance, some meteorites contain tiny grains of dust that are older than the Sun and originated from other stars. Other meteorites contain minerals that formed in the presence of water, suggesting that some asteroids were once wet and possibly habitable.</li><li>Meteorites can also tell us about the impact events that shaped the history of Earth and other worlds. By studying the size, frequency and effects of meteorite collisions, scientists can reconstruct the geological and biological consequences of these events. For example, some meteorites are fragments of a large asteroid that hit Earth 66 million years ago, causing a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs and most other life forms. Other meteorites are pieces of Mars or the Moon that were ejected by impacts and later captured by Earth's gravity.</li><li>Meteorites can also tell us about the interactions between Earth and its cosmic environment. By measuring the flux and variation of meteorites over time, scientists can infer how Earth's orbit, climate and biosphere have been influenced by external factors. For example, some meteorites show evidence of cosmic ray exposure, indicating how long they have been traveling in space before reaching Earth. Other meteorites show signs of weathering or biological activity, indicating how they have been altered by Earth's atmosphere or life forms.</li></ul><h6>Fireball, Meteorite, Reward, Maine, History, Solar System, Earth</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
