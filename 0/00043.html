In recent months, China has conducted frequent and large-scale military exercises near Taiwan, including simulating a blockade of the island with an aircraft carrier and dozens of warships and warplanes.</p><p>Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has vowed to defend the island's sovereignty and democracy, and has sought to bolster its military capabilities with the help of the United States, its most important security partner. The US does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the island with arms of a defensive nature.</p><h2>A contingency stockpile of US weapons</h2><p>One of the key measures that Taiwan is pursuing to enhance its defense is to establish a "contingency stockpile" of US munitions on the island, according to Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng. He told Taiwan's parliament in March that Taipei was in discussions with Washington over a potential plan to set up a war reserve stock on the island – a measure made possible by a provision in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by US President Joe Biden last December.</p><p>The provision authorizes the US Secretary of Defense to establish and maintain a stockpile of defense articles in or around Taiwan for use by US forces or Taiwan's military in case of an emergency. The provision also requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the feasibility and advisability of such a stockpile within 180 days of enactment.</p><p>Military experts say the creation of such a stockpile could be vital to Taiwan's defense because it could be very difficult to supply the island with additional weapons if war does break out. Unlike Ukraine, which borders several NATO countries and can receive assistance by land, Taiwan has no land borders and any supplies would have to go in by air or sea – delivery methods that would be highly vulnerable to interceptions by the Chinese military.</p><p>"It is therefore vital for Taiwan to stock up ammunition on the island before any conflict begins," said Admiral Lee Hsi-min, who served as Chief of the General Staff for the Taiwanese military between 2017 and 2019.</p><p>Lee said that Taiwan needs to have enough ammunition for at least three months of combat, and that some of the critical items that Taiwan should seek from the US include anti-ship missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, precision-guided munitions, torpedoes, and mines.</p><h2>Asymmetric warfare tactics</h2><p>Another aspect of Taiwan's defense strategy is to adopt asymmetric warfare tactics, which aim to exploit China's weaknesses and offset its overwhelming numerical and technological advantages. Asymmetric warfare refers to unconventional methods of warfare that involve using surprise, deception, mobility, speed, and creativity to inflict disproportionate damage on a stronger adversary.</p><p>Taiwan has been developing and deploying various weapons systems that fit this concept, such as mobile missile launchers, fast attack boats, stealthy minelayers, unmanned aerial vehicles, cyberwarfare units, and special operations forces. These weapons and units are designed to target China's key vulnerabilities, such as its dependence on sea lines of communication, its limited amphibious landing capabilities, its reliance on satellites and networks for command and control, and its lack of experience in modern warfare.</p><p>Taiwan's asymmetric warfare doctrine is also influenced by the concept of "porcupine strategy," which suggests that Taiwan should make itself so prickly and unpalatable that China would not want to swallow it. The idea is to deter China from launching an invasion by raising the costs and risks of such an action, and by convincing China that it would not be able to achieve a quick and decisive victory.</p><p>"Taiwan's goal is not to defeat China in a conventional sense, but to make China pay a very high price for any attempt to invade or coerce Taiwan," said Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, a US-based think tank that focuses on security issues in Asia.</p><p>Easton said that Taiwan's asymmetric warfare capabilities are impressive and improving, but they are not enough to guarantee its security. He said that Taiwan also needs to invest more in its conventional forces, such as submarines, fighter jets, tanks, artillery, and helicopters, which are essential for defending its territory and airspace. He also said that Taiwan needs more support from the international community, especially from like-minded democracies that share its values and interests.</p><h2>Rising international support for Taiwan</h2><p>In 2021, a growing number of countries have been willing to join the US in making statements supporting peace and stability in Taiwan, and some, including Canada and the UK, have sent military vessels to transit the Taiwan Strait. This can be explained at least in part as a reaction to Beijing's crackdown on political autonomy in Hong Kong in 2020, which effectively ended the 'one country, two systems' arrangement that had been in place.</p><p>The US, under presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden, has in recent years departed from several long-standing norms in its relations with Taiwan and is offering higher levels of political and military support to the island. In this environment it will be more difficult for China to isolate Taiwan when the two disagree.</p><p>In 2021, international support for Taiwan rose to its highest level since 1971, when Taipei lost its seat at the UN to the People's Republic of China. The US has been the most prominent major supporter of Taiwan since then, even though it does not formally recognize the island as an independent country. Currently, only 15 countries or territories recognize Taiwan and use its preferred name, the Republic of China. These are mostly small countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean or the South Pacific that rely on Taipei for economic assistance.</p><p>Although the US and many of its allies and partners show no sign that they will recognize the island anytime soon, they have demonstrated a new willingness in the last year to make statements in international forums supporting Taiwan's democracy or to subtly upgrade their diplomatic ties with Taipei, and some have also increased their naval presence in the waters around the island.</p><p>For example, Japan, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK have all expressed concern over China's military pressure on Taiwan and called for peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences. Some of these countries have also conducted naval exercises or patrols near Taiwan or sold weapons to the island.</p><p>The US has also been encouraging its allies and partners to support Taiwan and cooperate with it on various issues, such as trade, health, democracy, and human rights. The US and Taiwan signed a five-year agreement on health, tech and security in November 2020. A group of US defense contractors visited Taiwan in May 2021 to bolster bilateral security cooperation. Four US lawmakers introduced legislation in April 2021 that would enable the Pentagon to cooperate with Taiwan in fortifying its cybersecurity against China.</p><p>These actions are seen as a show of solidarity and deterrence to Taiwan and a signal of warning and challenge to China. However, they also risk provoking China's anger and retaliation, which could escalate tensions and increase the risk of conflict.</p><h2>US security cooperation and assistance</h2><p>Taiwan's defense strategy also relies on the US security cooperation and assistance, which has been growing in recent years amid rising tensions across the Taiwan Strait. The US has approved several major arms sales to Taiwan since 2020, totaling more than $18 billion, including F-16 fighter jets, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Patriot air defense systems, and MQ-9 Reaper drones.</p><p>The US has also increased its military presence and activities near Taiwan, such as sending warships through the Taiwan Strait, conducting joint exercises with Taiwan's coast guard, and flying spy planes over the island. These actions are seen as a show of support and deterrence to Taiwan and a signal of warning and challenge to China.</p><p>In addition, the US has been strengthening its diplomatic and political ties with Taiwan, despite China's protests and sanctions. The US has lifted some restrictions on official contacts with Taiwan, sent high-level delegations to visit the island, invited Taiwan to attend international forums, and expressed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in global organizations.</p><p>The US has also been encouraging its allies and partners to support Taiwan and cooperate with it on various issues, such as trade, health, democracy, and human rights. For example, Japan, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK have all expressed concern over China's military pressure on Taiwan and called for peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences. Some of these countries have also conducted naval exercises or patrols near Taiwan or sold weapons to the island.</p><p>However, the US has not explicitly committed to defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese attack, maintaining a policy of "strategic ambiguity" that leaves room for interpretation and flexibility. The US has also urged Taiwan to increase its defense spending and invest more in its own security.</p><h2>Challenges and uncertainties</h2><p>Taiwan's defense strategy faces several challenges and uncertainties in the face of China's growing military capabilities and assertiveness. China has been developing and deploying advanced weapons systems that could pose a serious threat to Taiwan's defenses, such as hypersonic missiles, stealth fighters, aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, submarines, cyberwarfare units, and space assets.</p><p>China has also been expanding its influence and leverage in the region and beyond, using economic incentives, political pressure, diplomatic isolation, and military coercion to undermine Taiwan's international space and legitimacy. China has persuaded seven countries to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing since 2016, leaving Taiwan with only 15 formal allies. China has also blocked Taiwan from participating in international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization.</p><p>Moreover, Taiwan's defense strategy depends largely on the US security commitment and assistance, which could be affected by various factors such as domestic politics, budget constraints, competing priorities, public opinion, and strategic calculations. The US may not be willing or able to intervene in a cross-strait conflict if it deems the costs or risks too high or if it faces other crises or challenges elsewhere.</p><p>Taiwan's defense strategy also requires the support and cooperation of its own people and society, which could be influenced by social cohesion, political polarization, economic development, cultural identity, and public morale. Taiwan may face challenges in mobilizing its population for national defense purposes if there is a lack of consensus or confidence in its government or military.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Taiwan's defense strategy is based on a combination of factors: a contingency stockpile of US weapons, asymmetric warfare tactics, US security cooperation and assistance, and rising international support. These factors aim to enhance Taiwan's military capabilities and deterrence against China's growing threat.</p><p>However, Taiwan's defense strategy also faces several challenges and uncertainties: China's growing military capabilities and assertiveness, China's expanding influence and leverage in the region and beyond, US security commitment and assistance that could be affected by various factors, and Taiwan's own social cohesion and political consensus.</p><p>Taiwan's defense strategy is not a guarantee of its security or survival. It is a dynamic and evolving process that requires constant adaptation and adjustment to changing circumstances. It also requires constant dialogue and communication with both China and the US to avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.</p><p>Taiwan's defense strategy is ultimately a means to an end: preserving its sovereignty and democracy. It is not an end in itself. It is not a provocation or a challenge to China. It is a response to China's pressure and coercion. It is a reflection of Taiwan's will and determination to defend itself.</p><h6>Taiwan, China, US, defense strategy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
