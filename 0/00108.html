But as Venezuela's economy collapses and its state oil firm PDVSA faces a corruption scandal, that agreement may be on increasingly shaky ground.</p><p>According to Jorge Piñón, a senior research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin's Energy Institute, Venezuela is selling its better quality crude to customers that can pay in cash, leaving Cuba with less and lower quality oil. Cuba produces about half the oil it needs, but it needs to mix it with the lighter crude supplied from foreign partners to be able to refine it.</p><h2>Cuba's fuel shortages and their impacts</h2><p>Since mid-April, Cuba has been beset with its most dire fuel shortages in years, prompting comparisons to the severe disruptions Cubans suffered after the fall of the Soviet Union. Lines stretch for blocks even at gas stations where there has been no fuel for days. While there is usually little traffic in Havana due to the difficulty of importing and maintaining cars, many main thoroughfares are strikingly empty. Across much of the island during the last few weeks there appeared to be more cars parked in gas lines than driving on the road.</p><p>While waiting to fill up his battered 1954 Plymouth, taxi driver Elien Reyes Castro complained it took two days in line to get enough gas for a single day of transporting customers. "I won't say what I think. It ain't easy, they sell too little, only 40 liters, that only gives me enough for one day, they won't give me more than that," he said.</p><p>The fuel crisis has also affected public transportation, agriculture, industry and tourism sectors, forcing many Cubans to cancel or postpone their plans for the May Day holiday. The government has announced measures to ration fuel and prioritize essential services, but also admitted that the countries that traditionally supply the island with oil have not been sending promised fuel.</p><p>The shortage has increased economic agony across the Caribbean nation, just as Cuba grapples with a continuing slump in tourism caused by the pandemic and soaring inflation that has precipitously increased the price of food. Late night fist fights have broken out at gas stations between drivers accusing one another of cutting the line – even among foreign diplomats who have their own gas station assigned to them but where, like everywhere else, there are infrequent deliveries of fuel. One diplomat told CNN that, in a recent incident, Russian diplomats angrily demanded their cars be allowed to go to the front of the long line of cars because Russia is another major fuel supplier for Cuba.</p><h2>Cuba's response and outlook</h2><p>Cuba's communist-run government has blamed US economic sanctions for the disruptions, saying they have prevented the island from accessing international credit and markets. The US has imposed a series of sanctions on Cuba since former President Donald Trump reversed some of the normalization policies initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama. The current President Joe Biden has not yet announced any changes to his Cuba policy, despite his campaign promises to ease some of the restrictions.</p><p>The Cuban authorities have also urged people to remain calm and patient, saying they are working to secure more oil shipments from other countries and diversify their energy sources. They have also encouraged Cubans to use renewable energy sources such as solar panels and biogas plants, as well as electric vehicles and bicycles.</p><p>However, some analysts doubt that Cuba will be able to overcome its chronic energy problems without significant reforms to its centralized and inefficient economic system. They also warn that the social discontent and frustration caused by the fuel shortages could lead to more protests and dissent in a country where dissent is tightly controlled.</p><p>Cuba has fuel shortages because of several factors, such as:</p><ul><li>The decline of oil shipments from Venezuela, its main ally and supplier, due to Venezuela's economic crisis and US sanctions.</li><li>The difficulty of finding alternative sources of oil and fuel in the international market, due to Cuba's lack of cash and US sanctions.</li><li>The failure of some of Cuba's power plants and the aging of its electrical grid, which increased the demand for fuel and reduced the efficiency of energy production.</li><li>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Cuba's tourism sector, which reduced its foreign exchange earnings and worsened its economic situation.</li></ul><p>These factors have led to long lines at gas stations, frequent blackouts, rationing measures, social unrest and economic hardship for many Cubans.</p><h6>Cuba, Venezuela, oil, fuel shortage, US sanctions</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
