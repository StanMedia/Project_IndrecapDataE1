The Starship spacecraft, riding atop the booster, soared out over the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>About two and a half minutes after takeoff, the Super Heavy rocket booster was scheduled to expend most of its fuel and separate from the Starship spacecraft, leaving the booster to be discarded in the ocean. The Starship was meant to use its own engines, blazing for more than six minutes, to propel itself to nearly orbital speeds.</p><h2>Starship explodes before stage separation</h2><p>However, something went wrong before stage separation. The Super Heavy booster did not detach from the Starship spacecraft as planned, and both vehicles exploded in midair.</p><p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted that there was "an anomaly shortly after liftoff" and that "teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test."</p><p>Despite the explosion, Thursday's test met several of the company's objectives for the vehicle. Clearing the launch pad was a major milestone for Starship. In the lead-up to Thursday's liftoff, Musk sought to temper expectations, saying, "success is not what should be expected...That would be insane."</p><p>"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's test will help us improve Starship's reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multi-planetary," SpaceX tweeted after the explosion.</p><h2>Starship aims for the moon and Mars</h2><p>Starship is part of SpaceX's ambitious vision to establish a human settlement on Mars. The spacecraft is designed to carry up to 100 people and 100 tons of cargo per flight. It is also intended to be fully reusable, meaning it can land and launch again multiple times.</p><p>Starship has also been selected by NASA as the vehicle that will land its astronauts on the moon as part of the Artemis program. SpaceX has a $2.9 billion contract with NASA to develop a lunar version of Starship that can ferry humans between lunar orbit and the surface.</p><p>Development of Starship has been based at SpaceX's privately held spaceport about 40 minutes outside Brownsville, Texas, on the US-Mexico border. The site is known as Starbase and has attracted throngs of spectators and enthusiasts who flock to watch Starship tests.</p><p>Before Thursday's test, Starship had flown five times without a Super Heavy booster. Four of those flights ended in fiery crashes, while one landed successfully but exploded shortly afterward.</p><p>SpaceX plans to conduct more test flights of Starship with Super Heavy boosters in the future, aiming to eventually reach orbit and beyond.</p><h6>SpaceX, Starship</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
