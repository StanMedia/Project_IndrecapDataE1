The vast bodies of water cover more than 70% of our planet and include mysterious regions like the "twilight zone", where an extraordinary number of species thrive beyond the reach of sunlight — and few researchers have ventured.</p><p>When scientists dived to the twilight zone and the mesophotic zone directly above it in recent years, they found colorful fish and sprawling pristine coral reefs. Now, technological innovations are helping scientists unlock this little explored deep-sea ecosystem in a fast-changing world.</p><h2>Ocean Census: A global initiative</h2><p>Researchers are hoping to shine a light on hidden marine life with an ambitious project called Ocean Census. The global initiative seeks to find 100,000 unknown species over the next 10 years. While scientists believe 2.2 million marine species exist in Earth's oceans, they estimate that they've only found 240,000, according to Ocean Census.</p><p>Identifying new species also enables conservationists to find ways to protect them as Earth changes due to the climate crisis. Scientists warn that the climate crisis could reduce twilight zone species by between 20% and 40% before the end of the century — and if greenhouse gas emissions aren't curbed, recovery could take thousands of years.</p><p>Ocean Census is led by a consortium of international organizations, including the Smithsonian Institution, the Natural History Museum in London, the University of Oxford, and the World Wildlife Fund. The project will involve divers, submarines, deep-sea robots, DNA analysis, and artificial intelligence to explore and catalog the ocean's biodiversity.</p><p>The project will also engage with local communities, governments, and businesses to raise awareness and support for ocean conservation. Ocean Census aims to create a comprehensive database of marine life that will be accessible to scientists, policymakers, educators, and the public.</p><h2>The benefits of ocean discovery</h2><p>Ocean Census is not only a scientific endeavor, but also a social and economic one. The project hopes to reveal the benefits of ocean discovery for human well-being and sustainable development.</p><p>The ocean provides essential services for humanity, such as food, oxygen, climate regulation, medicine, recreation, and cultural heritage. However, these services are under threat from overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species, and climate change.</p><p>By discovering new species and ecosystems, Ocean Census hopes to uncover new sources of food, medicine, biotechnology, and bioinspiration. For example, some deep-sea organisms have unique adaptations that could inspire new materials or devices for human use.</p><p>Ocean Census also hopes to foster a sense of wonder and curiosity about the ocean among people of all ages and backgrounds. By showcasing the beauty and diversity of marine life, Ocean Census hopes to inspire people to care for and protect the ocean.</p><h2>A challenge and an opportunity</h2><p>Ocean Census is one of the most ambitious and challenging projects ever undertaken in marine science. It will require unprecedented collaboration and coordination among scientists from different disciplines and countries. It will also face technical and logistical difficulties in accessing and sampling the deep sea.</p><p>However, Ocean Census is also an opportunity to advance our knowledge and appreciation of the ocean. It will provide a baseline for monitoring changes in ocean health and biodiversity. It will also contribute to global efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals , especially Goal 14: Life Below Water.</p><p>Ocean Census is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to discover and protect the hidden wonders of the deep sea. As one of the project leaders said: "We have a moral obligation to explore the ocean before it is too late."</p><h2>The goals and scope of Ocean Census</h2><p>Ocean Census is a global collaborative initiative to discover and record marine life hidden in the world's oceans.</p><p>Ocean Census aims to identify 100,000 unknown species in the next 10 years, allowing scientists to better understand and protect the deep-sea ecosystem. There are huge gaps in our knowledge of the ocean depths. Of the 2.2 million species believed to exist in the Earth's oceans, only 240,000 have been described by scientists, according to Ocean Census.</p><p>Ocean Census also hopes to reveal the benefits of ocean discovery for human well-being and sustainable development. The ocean provides essential services for humanity, such as food, oxygen, climate regulation, medicine, recreation, and cultural heritage. However, these services are under threat from overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species, and climate change.</p><p>By discovering new species and ecosystems, Ocean Census hopes to uncover new sources of food, medicine, biotechnology, and bioinspiration.

The project's headquarters is in Oxford, UK.</p><p>Ocean Census involves more than 50 partners from science, business, media and civil society organizations. Some of the key partners include:</p><ul><li>The Smithsonian Institution</li><li>The Natural History Museum in London</li><li>The University of Oxford</li><li>The World Wildlife Fund</li><li>The Schmidt Ocean Institute</li><li>The Wellcome Sanger Institute</li><li>Monaco Explorations</li></ul><p>Ocean Census is also supported by several governments and international bodies, such as:</p><ul><li>The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development</li><li>The Commonwealth Blue Charter</li><li>The High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy</li><li>The governments of Japan, UK, Monaco, Maldives, Seychelles and others</li></ul><h2>The methods and technologies of Ocean Census</h2><p>Ocean Census will use a variety of methods and technologies to explore and catalog the ocean's biodiversity. Some of the main methods include:</p><ul><li>Diving: Divers will collect specimens and data from shallow and mesophotic coral reefs using scuba gear or rebreathers.</li><li>Submarines: Submarines will access deeper regions of the ocean, such as the twilight zone and the abyssal plain, using manned or remotely operated vehicles.</li><li>Robots: Robots will deploy sensors and cameras to capture images and videos of marine life in different habitats and depths.</li><li>DNA: DNA analysis will identify species based on their genetic material extracted from tissue samples or environmental DNA (eDNA) collected from seawater.</li><li>AI: Artificial intelligence will help process and analyze large amounts of data and images generated by Ocean Census using machine learning and computer vision.</li></ul><p>Ocean Census will create a comprehensive database of marine life that will be accessible to scientists, policymakers, educators, and the public. Ocean Census will also produce educational materials, documentaries, exhibitions, and events to share its findings and engage with diverse audiences.</p><h6>Ocean Census; marine biodiversity; deep sea; twilight zone; coral reefs; climate change; conservation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
