His wife, surnamed Bei, believes he is the anonymous author of Program Think, a widely read blog that offered technical cybersecurity advice and scathing political commentary against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><p>Program Think was active for 12 years, from 2009 to 2021, and had amassed a loyal following of millions of readers inside and outside China. The blog provided tips on how to safely circumvent China's Great Firewall of internet censorship, develop critical thinking and resist the increasingly totalitarian rule of the CCP. The blogger also exposed the corruption and human rights abuses of the CCP leaders and officials, and expressed support for democracy movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p><p>The blogger took pride in their ability to cover their digital tracks and avoid getting caught - even as a growing number of government critics were ensnared in Chinese leader Xi Jinping's strident crackdown on dissent. The blogger used a stylized version of Rodin's "The Thinker" as an avatar on multiple platforms, including Twitter, GitHub and WeChat.</p><p>However, on May 9, 2021, Program Think suddenly went silent. The blog stopped updating and its Twitter and GitHub accounts turned dormant. Its author had promised followers to never stay inactive for more than 14 days. Many feared the blogger had been struck by an accident or illness, or tracked down and detained by authorities. Speculation abounded, yet no one was able to offer concrete evidence.</p><p>Program Think had so closely guarded their identity that no supporters knew who the blogger was - except that they had been a programmer inside mainland China with a decade-long career in information security.</p><p>Now, almost two years later, Bei has come forward to claim that her husband is Program Think. She told CNN that Ruan was taken away by police from his Shanghai home on May 10, 2021 - one day after Program Think's final blog post.</p><p>Ruan's detention caught Bei completely dumbfounded. And she would be even more shocked to learn her husband was blogging about politically sensitive subjects.</p><p>"The police told me his case was very serious, and I thought, how is it possible?" Bei said. "He's a tech nerd and he loved delving into technology. How could he have so much energy to write articles on current political affairs?"</p><p>Throughout the investigation and court procedures, Bei was unable to learn much detail about her husband's case as authorities told her it involved "state secrets." Ruan was tried in secret, and Bei only saw him again at his sentencing at the Shanghai No. 2 Intermediate Court on February 10 this year, she said.</p><p>According to Bei, Ruan did not admit to being Program Think during his trial. He only confessed to writing some online articles that criticized the CCP under other pseudonyms. He also apologized for his actions and expressed remorse.</p><p>Bei said she did not know why Ruan chose to blog anonymously about politics. She said they never discussed such topics at home, and she had no idea he was Program Think until she saw some evidence presented by the police.</p><p>"I think he just wanted to express his opinions and share his knowledge with others," she said. "He never intended to incite subversion or overthrow the regime."</p><p>Bei said she respected her husband's choices and admired his courage. She said she hoped he would be released soon and reunited with their two young children.</p><p>"I miss him very much. He's a good husband and a good father," she said.</p><p>Ruan's case is not an isolated one. In recent years, China has intensified its crackdown on online dissent, arresting and jailing dozens of bloggers, journalists, activists and lawyers who dared to challenge the CCP's narrative or expose its wrongdoings.</p><p>In January 2020, citizen journalist Chen Qiushi went missing after reporting on the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. He has not been heard from since.</p><p>In December 2020, citizen journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years in prison for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" after reporting on the same outbreak. She went on a hunger strike in protest and is reportedly in poor health.</p><p>In June 2021, former lawyer Pu Zhiqiang was given a three-year suspended sentence for "inciting ethnic hatred" and "picking quarrels" in his social media posts. Pu was a prominent human rights lawyer who defended dissidents, journalists and activists. He was detained in 2014 after attending a seminar that commemorated the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.</p><p>In September 2021, former journalist Gao Yu was sentenced to four years in prison for "leaking state secrets" to a foreign website. Gao was a veteran reporter who had covered sensitive topics such as political reform, corruption and human rights. She was accused of sending a document that outlined the CCP's strategy to curb Western influence and civil society.</p><p>In November 2021, former diplomat Yang Hengjun was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "espionage" by a Beijing court. Yang was an Australian citizen who had written online articles that criticized the CCP's policies and advocated for democracy. He was arrested in 2019 after arriving in China from New York.</p><p>These cases have drawn international condemnation and raised concerns about the shrinking space for free expression and dissent in China. The United States, the European Union, Australia and several human rights groups have called on China to release the jailed bloggers and respect their rights.</p><p>However, China has rejected such criticism as interference in its internal affairs and insisted that it is upholding the rule of law. Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Tuesday that Ruan's case had been handled "in accordance with the law" and that "foreign governments should respect China's judicial sovereignty."</p><p>China has also tightened its control over the internet, blocking foreign websites such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, and censoring domestic platforms such as Weibo and WeChat. It has also enacted laws that require online users to register with their real names and prohibit them from spreading "rumors" or "harmful information."</p><p>According to a report by Freedom House, a US-based watchdog, China ranked last among 65 countries in terms of internet freedom in 2021. The report said that China's internet censorship had reached "unprecedented extremes" during the coronavirus pandemic and that online users faced severe punishments for expressing dissenting views.</p><p>Despite the risks, some Chinese netizens have continued to voice their opinions and challenge the official narrative online. They have used various methods to evade censorship, such as using euphemisms, satire, memes and encryption tools.</p><p>Some have also expressed their support and admiration for Program Think and other jailed bloggers, calling them heroes and martyrs of free speech. They have also urged them to stay strong and hopeful.</p><p>One user wrote on Twitter: "Program Think, you are not alone. We are all Program Think. We will never give up our right to think and speak freely."</p><p>Another user wrote on Weibo: "Ruan Xiaohuan, you are an inspiration to us all. You have sacrificed so much for the truth and justice. We will always remember you and your work."</p><h6>China, blogger, human rights, censorship</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
