InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The lander is equipped with a seismometer, a heat probe and a radio science experiment that can measure marsquakes, heat flow and planetary wobble.</p><h2>What did InSight discover?</h2><p>InSight has detected hundreds of marsquakes and one meteorite impact since it began its operation on Mars. Two of these events, a marsquake on May 22, 2019 and a meteorite impact on March 7, 2020, generated seismic waves that traveled through the Martian core for the first time. These waves were recorded by InSight's seismometer and analyzed by scientists to determine the size, density and composition of the core.</p><h2>What is the Martian core like?</h2><p>Scientists have used InSight's data to estimate that Mars has a liquid iron-alloy core that also includes lightweight elements such as sulfur and oxygen, as well as smaller amounts of hydrogen and carbon. The core has a radius of about 1,110 miles (1,790 kilometers), which is slightly smaller and denser than previously thought. The core is entirely liquid, unlike Earth's core which has a solid inner part and a liquid outer part.</p><h2>Why is this important?</h2><p>Studying the Martian core can help scientists understand how Mars and other rocky planets formed and evolved over time. The core is a record of the planet's history, from its accretion to its differentiation to its cooling. The core also influences the planet's magnetic field, which affects its atmosphere and climate. Mars once had a global magnetic field that protected it from solar winds, but it lost it about 4 billion years ago. This may have contributed to the loss of water and habitable conditions on Mars.</p><h2>What are the next steps?</h2><p>InSight's mission has been extended until December 2022, which means it will continue to monitor seismic activity on Mars and collect more data about its interior. Scientists hope to detect more seismic waves that can reveal information about other layers of Mars, such as the mantle and the crust. They also hope to improve their models of the Martian core by combining seismic data with other measurements from InSight and other missions.</p><h2>How does Mars compare to Earth?</h2><p>Mars is about half the size of Earth, but both planets have similar crustal thicknesses. However, Mars has a much thinner mantle and a larger core relative to its size than Earth. This suggests that Mars cooled faster than Earth and may have had less internal activity such as plate tectonics and volcanism. The composition of Mars' crust is also different from Earth's; it is mainly basaltic with some feldspar-rich rocks, while Earth's crust is more diverse with continental and oceanic types.</p><p>Mars' mantle is composed of silicate minerals rich in iron and magnesium, similar to Earth's mantle. However, Mars' mantle may have lower concentrations of radioactive elements that generate heat inside the planet. This could explain why Mars' mantle convection is weaker than Earth's and why Mars does not have a global magnetic field anymore.</p><p>Mars' core is made of iron alloyed with nickel and other elements such as sulfur, oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. These elements lower the melting point of iron and make the core more fluid. Earth's core also contains these elements, but in lower amounts. Earth's core has two layers: a liquid outer core that generates a magnetic field by dynamo action, and a solid inner core that crystallized from the outer core over time. Mars' core does not have this distinction; it is entirely liquid and does not produce a magnetic field.</p><h6>InSight, Mars, core, seismic waves</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
