The community organizer led a six-year legal battle in the UK that eventually led to Vedanta Resources and its subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) paying compensation to 2,500 Zambian villagers, although the companies admitted no liability.</p><p>Along the way, Mumba helped to set a new precedent, allowing a British company to be sued for the actions of its subsidiary in another country.</p><p>On Monday, Mumba, 38, was awarded the 2023 Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa for his work for the community and setting legal precedent.</p><p>"It's a wonderful feeling to receive this award," he told CNN. "It's the culmination of work which was done, not just by me but even the community themselves ... who stood up against injustice and stood with us for six years."</p><p>Mumba, a father of three, is one of six global winners of the prestigious award, which honors grassroots environmental activists. The prize is awarded each year by The Goldman Environmental Foundation, with ceremonies in San Francisco and Washington, DC.</p><h2>Zambian economy relies on copper mining</h2><p>Zambia is Africa's second-biggest copper producer and its economy relies heavily on copper mining, which generates more than half of its revenue from exports, according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).</p><p>However, copper mining also poses serious environmental and social risks. According to a 2019 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), mining companies have polluted rivers and streams with acid mine drainage and heavy metals such as lead and cadmium.</p><p>The report also found that many communities living near mining operations have limited access to clean water and sanitation services. Some residents have reported health problems such as skin diseases, respiratory infections, and miscarriages.</p><p>HRW urged the Zambian government and mining companies to take urgent steps to protect the rights of affected communities and ensure they have access to information, health care, and remedies.</p><h2>Vedanta Resources faces criticism over human rights record</h2><p>Vedanta Resources is one of the world's largest diversified natural resources companies with interests in zinc-lead-silver, iron ore, steel, copper, aluminium, power generation and oil and gas.</p><p>The company operates in India, Zambia, Namibia, South Africa, Liberia and Australia. It has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2003.</p><p>However, Vedanta Resources has also faced criticism over its human rights record and environmental impact in several countries where it operates.</p><p>In India, Vedanta Resources has been accused of violating indigenous peoples' rights and causing environmental damage through its bauxite mining project in Odisha state. In 2018, Indian authorities ordered Vedanta Resources to shut down its copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu state after protests over alleged pollution turned violent and resulted in 13 deaths.</p><p>In Zambia, Vedanta Resources has been involved in several legal disputes with the Zambian government over taxes and royalties. In 2019, the Zambian government announced its intention to liquidate KCM and take over its assets, citing breaches of environmental and financial regulations. However, Vedanta Resources challenged the decision in court and obtained an injunction to halt the liquidation process.</p><p>Vedanta Resources has denied any wrongdoing and said it is committed to operating responsibly and sustainably in all its locations. The company has also said it is open to dialogue and cooperation with all its stakeholders.</p><h2>Vedanta Resources: A global mining giant</h2><p>Vedanta Resources is a UK-Indian diversified mining company headquartered in London, United Kingdom. It is the largest mining and non-ferrous metals company in India and has mining operations in Australia and Zambia and oil and gas operations in three countries. Its main products are Zinc, Lead, Silver, Oil &amp; Gas, Iron Ore, Steel, Aluminium and Power.</p><p>The company was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1976 by Anil Agarwal, as a scrap-metal dealership. In 1979, he acquired the Shamsher Sterling Corporation (subsequently renamed Sterlite Industries), a manufacturer of power and control cables.</p><p>The company expanded its business through acquisitions and organic growth, becoming one of the world's leading natural resources conglomerates. It has also developed commercial power stations in India in Odisha (2,400 MW) and Punjab (1,980 MW).</p><p>The company is primarily owned by the family of Anil Agarwal through Volcan Investments, a holding vehicle with a 61.7% stake in the business.

It has been accused of violating indigenous peoples' rights and causing environmental damage through its bauxite mining project in Odisha state, India. It has also been involved in several legal disputes with the Zambian government over taxes and royalties from its copper mining operations.</p><p>The company has denied any wrongdoing and said it is committed to operating responsibly and sustainably in all its locations.
