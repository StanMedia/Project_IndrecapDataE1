The lander, which launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on December 11, 2022, was carrying the Rashid rover, the first Arab-built lunar spacecraft, developed by Dubai's Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p><p>The mission was part of ispace's Hakuto program, which competed in the Google Lunar XPrize, a contest that offered a $20 million reward to the first privately funded team that could land a robotic rover on the moon, travel at least 500 meters, and transmit data back to Earth. The competition ended in 2018 without a winner, but ispace continued to pursue its lunar ambitions with the support of various partners and sponsors.</p><p>The Hakuto-R lander was designed to demonstrate ispace's technology and capabilities for future lunar exploration and utilization. The company plans to launch another lander in 2023, followed by a series of missions to establish a lunar transportation system by 2025.</p><h2>A tragic outcome</h2><p>The Hakuto-R lander spent about three months traveling to the moon using a low-energy trajectory that covered about 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) in space. It entered orbit around the moon on March 21, 2023, and began preparing for its descent to the lunar surface.</p><p>The landing attempt was scheduled for Tuesday at 12:40 p.m. ET (Wednesday at 1:40 a.m. Japan Standard Time), targeting a site near the Atlas Crater on the northeast of the moon. The lander was supposed to perform a series of maneuvers to reduce its speed and altitude, using its thrusters and sensors to navigate autonomously.</p><p>However, something went wrong during the final minutes of the descent. Flight controllers in Tokyo lost contact with the lander when it was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) above the lunar surface. The cause of the anomaly is still unknown, but it is presumed that the lander either crashed or suffered a crippling malfunction that prevented it from completing its mission.</p><p>"We are deeply saddened by this outcome," said Takeshi Hakamada, founder and CEO of ispace, in a statement. "We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our partners and supporters who have made this mission possible. We will conduct a thorough investigation and learn from this experience to improve our technology and operations for our next missions."</p><h2>A lost opportunity</h2><p>The failure of the Hakuto-R lander also dashed the hopes of the UAE, which had entrusted ispace with carrying its Rashid rover to the moon. The rover, named after Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, was intended to be the first Arab spacecraft to explore the lunar surface.</p><p>The Rashid rover weighed about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) and carried six scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and magnetometers. It was designed to study the lunar soil, dust, plasma, and magnetic field, as well as test new technologies such as 3D-printed wheels and solar cells.</p><p>The rover was also expected to spend most of the 14-day lunar daytime exploring the Atlas Crater, which has unique features such as exposed bedrock and lava tubes that could provide clues about the moon's geology and history.</p><p>"We are disappointed by this outcome, but we are proud of our team and partners who have worked hard to make this mission possible," said Yousuf Hamad AlShaibani, director general of MBRSC, in a statement. "We congratulate ispace for their courage and perseverance in pursuing this challenging endeavor. We remain committed to advancing our space program and contributing to humanity's exploration and understanding of the moon."</p><h2>A future challenge</h2><p>The Hakuto-R mission was one of several commercial lunar initiatives that have emerged in recent years, driven by technological advances, lower launch costs, and growing interest from governments and private entities.</p><p>In 2019, Israel's SpaceIL became the first private organization to attempt a lunar landing with its Beresheet spacecraft, but it also failed due to a technical glitch during its descent due to a technical glitch during its final braking maneuver. In 2020, India's Chandrayaan-2 mission also failed to land softly on the moon after losing contact with its Vikram lander during the last phase of its descent.</p><p>These failures highlight the difficulty and complexity of landing on the moon, which requires precise timing, navigation, and control. The moon's gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, making it challenging to slow down a spacecraft without using too much or too little fuel. The lunar terrain is also rugged and uneven, posing hazards for landing and roving.</p><p>Despite these challenges, several countries and companies are planning to send more missions to the moon in the coming years, driven by scientific curiosity, commercial interests, and geopolitical ambitions. NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the moon by 2024 and establish a sustainable presence there by 2028. China's Chang'e program has successfully landed two rovers on the far side and near side of the moon, and plans to launch a sample return mission later this year. Russia, Japan, Europe, and Canada are also developing lunar missions or collaborating with other partners.</p><p>The moon is not only a fascinating destination for exploration and discovery, but also a potential source of resources and a strategic outpost for future space endeavors. As more actors join the lunar race, there will be more opportunities for cooperation and competition, as well as more challenges for ensuring safety and sustainability.</p><h2>A hopeful future</h2><p>Although Japan's ispace failed to achieve its goal of becoming the first commercial company to land on the moon, it has not given up on its vision of opening up a new era of lunar exploration and utilization. The company has already secured contracts with NASA and JAXA, Japan's space agency, to deliver payloads to the moon on its next missions.</p><p>The company has also expressed its gratitude and respect to its partners and supporters, especially the UAE, which entrusted ispace with carrying its Rashid rover. The UAE has made remarkable achievements in space in recent years, such as launching its Hope orbiter to Mars in 2020 and sending its first astronaut to the International Space Station in 2019. The country has also announced plans to build a human settlement on Mars by 2117.</p><p>Both ispace and MBRSC have stated that they will learn from this experience and improve their technology and operations for their future missions. They have also reaffirmed their commitment to advancing their space programs and contributing to humanity's exploration and understanding of the moon.</p><p>"We are not discouraged by this outcome," said Adnan AlRais, Mars 2117 program manager at MBRSC. "We are inspired by the courage and perseverance of ispace and our team. We believe that this mission has paved the way for more collaboration and innovation in the commercial lunar sector. We look forward to continuing our partnership with ispace and achieving our common goals."</p><h6>Japan, UAE, ispace, Hakuto-R, Rashid rover</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
