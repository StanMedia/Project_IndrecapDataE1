The bill outlaws identifying as LGBTQ+, and suggests life sentences for convicted homosexuals as well as the death penalty for "aggravated homosexuality," a sweeping term covering various sexual acts including sex with people with mental or physical disabilities or sex with children.</p><p>The bill also criminalizes the promotion of homosexuality, the provision of health services to LGBTQ+ people, and the failure to report suspected homosexuals to the authorities. Those who violate these provisions could face up to 20 years in jail.</p><p>The bill has been widely condemned by human rights groups, foreign governments, and international organizations as a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said the bill "would institutionalize discrimination and is an affront to the human dignity of its people." The US State Department said it was "deeply troubled" by the bill and urged President Museveni to "respect the human rights of all Ugandans."</p><h2>The scientists' open letter and arguments</h2><p>Before the bill was passed almost unanimously last month, President Museveni called on scientists to establish whether homosexuality was natural or learned. Museveni has previously called homosexuals "deviations from normal."</p><p>In their open letter, the group of scientists state: "We cannot say this enough: homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality. The science on this subject is crystal clear and we call on you [Museveni] in the strongest possible terms to veto the bill in the name of science."</p><p>The letter has been signed by 15 leading scientists around the world, from countries including South Africa, the United States, Canada, the UK, Kenya, and Australia. They include Nobel laureates, professors, researchers, and experts in various fields of biology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and medicine.</p><p>The scientists write that genetics play a role in homosexuality, and that the practice cannot be caught like a "common cold." Nor can homosexuality be indoctrinated, they say: "Exposure to rainbow flags will not make a child gay."</p><p>They also cite historical and cross-cultural evidence that homosexuality is not limited to any specific region or time period. "It is not confined by borders drawn on a map. It needs no passport to travel. Indeed, there's clear evidence for same sex relationships in Africa dating back hundreds of years," the letter adds.</p><p>The scientists urge President Museveni to listen to their scientific arguments and to respect the diversity of human sexuality. They warn that passing the bill would have devastating consequences for Uganda's LGBTQ+ community and its reputation in the world. "We implore you to do what is right for your country and your people," they conclude.</p><h6>Uganda, LGBTQ+, anti-homosexuality bill, science</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
