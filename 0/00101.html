A point for either player in the final classic game Saturday would have won them the championship.</p><p>But at the St Regis Astana Hotel, Kazakhstan, Ding managed to stop Nepomniachtchi from winning the championship with a 90-move escape. The scores remained level, at 7-7, after more than six hours at the board.</p><p>Four rapid tiebreaks will be played Sunday and if it's still a tie blitz games will determine the winner. Rapid chess has the same rules as classical games, but players have less time to make their moves. In Sunday's rapid playoff, there will be a time control of 25 minutes for each player, plus a 10-second increment per move.</p><p>If after four rapid games the championship is still tied, a two-game playoff with a time control of five minutes, plus three second per move, will be played, followed by another two-game playoff with the same time control if still level.</p><p>If the players still can't be separated, games with a time control of three minutes for each player, plus two seconds per move, will be played until there is a result.</p><p>This World Championship is rather different to previous editions as Magnus Carlsen, the reigning champion, decided not to defend his title. American great Bobby Fischer was the last grandmaster to give up his world title in 1975.</p><p>Ding will be playing with his white pieces for the winner-takes-all game. Stanislav Filippov/AP</p><p>In Carlsen's absence, Nepomniachtchi has faced world No. 3 Liren, the highest-rated Chinese player in history, in a back-and-forth tussle. Whoever wins, the sport will crown a first-time champion, with Ding a debutant and Nepomniachtchi losing to Carlsen in 2021 in his only championship appearance.</p><p>Ding had momentum after Nepomniachtchi's Game 12 loss and managed to hold on to a draw in Game 13 despite being under pressure. In Game 14, he had the advantage of playing with his white pieces and was able to neutralize Nepomniachtchi's attack.</p><p>The championship is broadcast live on Chess.com from 5am ET.</p><h2>The history and significance of the World Chess Championship</h2><p>The World Chess Championship is one of the oldest and most prestigious competitions in sports history. It dates back to 1886 when Wilhelm Steinitz became the first official world champion by defeating Johannes Zukertort in a match.</p><p>Since then, the title has been contested by some of the greatest minds and personalities of chess, such as Emanuel Lasker, Jose Raul Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Mikhail Botvinnik, Bobby Fischer, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen.</p><p>The World Chess Championship is not only a test of skill and strategy, but also of endurance and psychology. The matches can last for weeks or even months, with each game taking several hours. The players have to cope with immense pressure and stress as they face their opponent across the board.</p><p>The World Chess Championship also reflects the political and cultural changes of the times. For instance, during the Cold War era, chess was seen as a symbolic battleground between the Soviet Union and the West. The famous match between Fischer and Boris Spassky in 1972 was dubbed as "the match of the century" and attracted worldwide attention.</p><p>The World Chess Championship also showcases the diversity and evolution of chess styles and ideas. Each champion has brought their own distinctive approach and contribution to the game, influencing generations of players and fans.</p><p>The World Chess Championship is not only a sport event, but also a cultural phenomenon that transcends borders and languages. It is a celebration of human intellect and creativity that inspires millions of people around the world.</p><h2>Ding Liren: The first Chinese world chess champion</h2><p>Ding Liren is the first Chinese player to become the world chess champion, a historic achievement for himself and his country.</p><p>Ding was born in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, on October 24, 1992. He learned chess from his father when he was four years old and soon showed remarkable talent. He won the national youth chess championship at the age of nine and became a grandmaster at 16.</p><p>Ding rose to prominence in the international chess scene by winning three Chinese chess championships (2009, 2011, 2012) and representing China at four Chess Olympiads (2012, 2014, 2016, 2018), winning team gold medals in 2014 and 2018, and individual bronze and gold medals in 2014 and 2018, respectively. He also won team gold and individual silver at the World Team Championships in 2015.</p><p>Ding became the first Chinese player to break into the top 10 of the FIDE world rankings in August 2015 and the first Chinese player to pass the 2800 Elo mark in September 2018. He reached a peak rating of 2816 in November 2018, the joint-tenth highest rating in history.</p><p>Ding qualified for his first Candidates Tournament in 2018 by winning the Chess World Cup 2017. He finished fourth in the Candidates Tournament with an undefeated score of +1-0=13. He qualified for his second Candidates Tournament in 2020 by finishing second in the FIDE Grand Prix 2019. He finished second again in the Candidates Tournament 2020/2021 with a score of +3-2=9.</p><p>Ding became the challenger for the World Chess Championship 2023 after Magnus Carlsen, the reigning champion, decided not to defend his title. He faced Ian Nepomniachtchi, the winner of the Candidates Tournament, in a best-of-14 match in Astana, Kazakhstan. The match was tied at 7-7 after 14 classical games and went to a rapid-play tiebreaker. Ding won the tiebreaker by a score of 2.5-1.5 and became the new world chess champion.</p><p>Ding is known for his solid and universal style of play, with excellent positional understanding and endgame technique. He is also capable of sharp and dynamic play when needed. He is admired for his fighting spirit and resilience, as he demonstrated by bouncing back from a bicycle accident that fractured his hip in 2017 and by overcoming a difficult start at the Candidates Tournament 2020/2021.</p><p>Ding is also a well-educated and modest person. He graduated from Peking University Law School in 2016 and speaks fluent English. He is popular among his fellow players and fans for his friendly and respectful demeanor.</p><p>Ding's victory is a milestone for Chinese chess, which has been developing rapidly in recent years. China has produced many strong players, especially among women, who have dominated the women's world championships since 1991. China also has a large and enthusiastic chess community, with millions of online players and fans.</p><p>Ding's achievement is also a source of pride and inspiration for his countrymen, who have followed his progress with great interest and support. He has received congratulations from many prominent figures, including President Xi Jinping, who praised him for "displaying the spirit of Chinese chess".</p><p>Ding is now the third Asian player to hold the world chess title, after Tigran Petrosian of Armenia (1963-1969) and Viswanathan Anand of India (2000-2002, 2007-2013). He is also the youngest world champion since Vladimir Kramnik of Russia (2000-2006).</p><p>Ding will face new challenges as the world champion, as he will have to defend his title against future challengers and compete in various elite tournaments. He will also have to balance his chess career with his personal life, as he recently got married to his longtime girlfriend.</p><p>Ding has expressed his gratitude to his family, coaches, teammates and fans for their support and encouragement. He has also expressed his respect and admiration for Carlsen, whom he considers "the strongest player ever". He has said that he hopes to play against Carlsen someday and that he will try to improve his chess further.</p><p>Ding Liren is not only a great chess player, but also a great ambassador for chess and China. He has made history by becoming the first Chinese world chess champion and has brought joy and pride to his nation. He has also shown the world the beauty and depth of chess and the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship. He is a worthy successor to the chess legends who came before him and a role model for the chess lovers who will follow him.</p><h6>World Chess Championship, Ian Nepomniachtchi, Ding Liren</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
