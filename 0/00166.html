That would mark the central bank's 11th consecutive rate increase.</p><p>Perhaps even more surprising, markets no longer believe the Fed will cut rates in 2023. That's a drastic about-face from even earlier this month, when Wall Street expected the central bank to slash rates multiple times this year starting as early as this summer.</p><h2>Why is the economy so strong?</h2><p>While a strong economy does give the Fed more leeway to raise rates, it also means the US is remaining resilient in the face of the central bank's aggressive campaign to tame inflation.</p><p>Of course, the economy's strength is nothing new. Some investors who previously expected a recession have in recent months seen more indications that the economy could enter a Goldilocks scenario, where both inflation and economic growth are modest, says Peter Essele, senior vice president of investment management and research for Commonwealth Financial Network.</p><p>Moreover, the bond market is showing some signals that traders are easing their bets on a possible recession later this year. The 2-year Treasury yield is at its highest level since early March, before the failures of regional lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank sparked fears of a recession and sent the yield sharply downward.</p><p>The US economy has also benefited from several factors that have boosted consumer spending and business confidence, such as:</p><ul><li>The successful rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions across the country.</li><li>The massive fiscal stimulus from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided direct payments to millions of Americans and extended unemployment benefits.</li><li>The rebound in global trade and manufacturing activity after a slump caused by the pandemic and supply chain disruptions.</li><li>The recovery in oil prices and energy demand after a historic crash last year.</li></ul><h2>What's next for the Fed and the markets?</h2><p>There are still several important economic readings that the Fed will parse before its next interest rate decision on June 14.</p><p>The May jobs report is due next Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, and early estimates from economists show job gains of 180,000 and a tick up in the unemployment rate to 3.5%.</p><p>"If it comes in hotter than expected, it almost locks a rate hike in" for June, said Heppenstall.</p><p>Other indicators to watch include consumer confidence, inflation expectations, retail sales, industrial production, and housing market data.</p><p>The Fed has repeatedly stressed that it will not overreact to temporary spikes in inflation or growth and that it will keep its monetary policy accommodative until it sees "substantial further progress" toward its goals of maximum employment and stable prices.</p><p>However, some analysts believe that the Fed may soon start signaling its intention to taper its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program, which has helped keep borrowing costs low and supported financial markets during the pandemic.</p><p>"The Fed will likely begin discussing tapering at its June meeting and announce tapering at its September meeting," wrote Goldman Sachs economists in a note on Friday.</p><p>They added that they expect the Fed to start reducing its bond purchases by $15 billion per month in November and end them by mid-2023.</p><p>The prospect of less Fed stimulus could cause some volatility and uncertainty in the markets, especially for sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as technology, utilities, and real estate.</p><p>However, some investors may welcome a more hawkish Fed as a sign of confidence in the economic recovery and a safeguard against runaway inflation.</p><p>"The Fed is not going to kill the economy by raising rates," said Essele. "They are going to do it because they think the economy can handle it."</p><h6>Fed, rate hike, inflation, GDP, PCE</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
