The blast injured one person and damaged some utensils, according to police.</p><p>The security personnel of the temple managed to catch three suspects, who were staying at an inn inside the temple complex, with the help of CCTV footage. The suspects allegedly threw a bomb from the rooftop of the inn.</p><p>The police later arrested two more suspects, who were allegedly involved in assembling the bombs and supplying the materials. The police also seized their electronic devices and phones.</p><h2>Previous blasts triggered panic</h2><p>The first blast took place on Saturday night near a public toilet on the Heritage Street leading to the Golden Temple. The blast injured one person and shattered some window panes.</p><p>The second blast happened on Monday morning near a garbage dump on the same street. The blast injured six people, including two women and a child, and damaged some vehicles.</p><p>The blasts triggered panic among the devotees and tourists visiting the temple, which is famous for its gold-encrusted dome and surrounding clear waters. The temple houses the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism.</p><p>The police had tightened the security around the temple and conducted flag marches with the support of paramilitary forces. They had also detained some suspects and questioned them.</p><h2>Motive still unclear</h2><p>The police said that the five suspects have confessed to their involvement in all three blasts, but did not reveal their motive or affiliation.</p><p>Gaurav Yadav, the police chief of Punjab, said that it was too early to speculate about a motive and an investigation was ongoing. He said that the terror angle cannot be ruled out.</p><p>He added that the Punjab Police are committed to maintaining peace and harmony in Punjab as per chief minister Bhagwant Mann's directions.</p><p>Sikhism is a minority religion in India, but accounts for nearly 60% of Punjab's 28 million population. Sikhs have faced violence and discrimination in the past, especially during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that followed the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.</p><p>The Golden Temple has also witnessed violence in the past. In 1984, the Indian army stormed the temple and killed Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a leader of an outlawed separatist movement that seeks to establish a sovereign state for Sikhs called Khalistan.</p><p>In January this year, a man was allegedly beaten to death after entering the temple, grabbing a bejeweled ceremonial sword and swinging it over his head – before being overpowered by devotees.</p><h2>Security measures enhanced</h2><p>Harjinder Singh Dhami, the head of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) that manages Sikh places of worship, accused the government of negligence in handling the matter and taking it lightly.</p><p>He said that if the government had taken the previous two explosions seriously, the third explosion would not have taken place.</p><p>He said that a scanner will be installed for the devotees entering the Golden Temple and appealed to devotees to carry only necessary things while visiting the shrine.</p><p>He also appreciated SGPC employees for catching the suspects with the help of technology within hours of the third blast.</p><p>He asked pilgrims to visit the shrine without fear as the situation is entirely peaceful.</p><h6>Amritsar, Golden Temple, bomb blasts, arrests</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
