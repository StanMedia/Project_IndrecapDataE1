He was convicted of kidnapping a businessman in 2018 and sentenced to life imprisonment in March this year. He was also facing dozens of other cases, including murder, extortion, and assault.</p><p>Ashraf Ahmed was his younger brother and a former state legislator from the regional Samajwadi Party (SP). He was also accused of several criminal offences, including murder and kidnapping.</p><p>The two brothers belonged to India's Muslim minority and hailed from Prayagraj, also known as Allahabad, a city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.</p><h2>How did the attack happen?</h2><p>The attack took place on Saturday night, when Atiq Ahmed and Ashraf Ahmed were being taken in handcuffs by police to a hospital for a routine medical check-up. They were surrounded by reporters and cameramen who wanted to interview them.</p><p>As they were speaking to the media, three men who had arrived on motorcycles and posed as journalists pulled out guns and fired multiple shots at them from close range. The incident was captured on live television and shared widely on social media.</p><p>The two brothers sustained bullet injuries to their heads and died within minutes. A policeman and a journalist were also injured in the crossfire.</p><p>The three assailants quickly surrendered to the police after the shooting. They were identified as Lavlesh Tiwari, Arun Maurya, and Sunny Singh, all residents of Uttar Pradesh. One of them was heard chanting "Jai Shri Ram" (Hail Lord Ram), a slogan that has become a rallying cry for Hindu nationalists in their campaign against Muslims.</p><h2>What was the motive behind the attack?</h2><p>The police have not revealed the motive behind the attack or the affiliation of the assailants. They said they were interrogating them and investigating the case.</p><p>However, some experts and observers have raised questions about the possible sectarian angle of the attack, as well as the security lapse that allowed it to happen.</p><p>Atiq Ahmed had claimed in a petition to India's Supreme Court last month that his life was under threat from the police in Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He had also alleged that he was tortured and denied medical treatment in prison.</p><p>His lawyer, Vijay Mishra, said the shooting was shocking because "it is a clear failure of the police in ensuring the safety" of his clients.</p><p>Some opposition leaders and journalists also condemned the attack as a sign of lawlessness and anarchy in Uttar Pradesh, which has witnessed several cases of violence and hate crimes against Muslims under the BJP government.</p><p>Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state and a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP, tweeted: "I am shocked by the brazen anarchy and total collapse of law &amp; order in Uttar Pradesh. It is shameful that perpetrators are now taking the law in their own hands, unfazed by the police and media presence. Such unlawful acts have no place in our constitutional democracy."</p><h2>What is the background of this case?</h2><p>Atiq Ahmed's political career began in 1989, when he won his first election as an independent candidate and became a state lawmaker. He went on to win three more terms in the state assembly and one term in the national parliament as a member of the SP.</p><p>However, he also had a long history of involvement in criminal activities. He was first accused of murder in 1979 and since then faced more than 90 cases of various offences. He was known as a mafia don-turned-politician who wielded considerable influence and power in his region.</p><p>In 2018, he was arrested for kidnapping and assaulting a businessman at Deoria jail, where he was lodged awaiting trial in another case. A local court sentenced him and two others to life imprisonment for this crime in March this year.</p><p>He was also accused of orchestrating attacks on witnesses and rivals from prison. In 2019, India's Supreme Court ordered that he should be moved to a jail in Gujarat state after it emerged that he planned attacks on another businessman from a prison in Uttar Pradesh.</p><p>His son, Umar Ahmed, was also involved in criminal activities and was shot dead by police in an encounter on April 26, 2023. The police said he was part of a gang that killed a businessman named Umesh Pal on April 16, 2023. Umar Ahmed's brother Ali and four others were also arrested in connection with the case.</p><p>The police claimed that Umar Ahmed was the mastermind of the murder and had ordered his associate Asad to execute it. They said they had recovered a pistol and a motorcycle from him after the encounter.</p><p>However, Umar Ahmed's family and some opposition leaders alleged that he was killed in a staged encounter and demanded a judicial inquiry into his death. They also accused the police of torturing and harassing Atiq Ahmed and his family members.</p><h2>Atiq Ahmed's life and deeds</h2><p>Atiq Ahmed was a former Indian politician who had a long and controversial career in politics and crime.
