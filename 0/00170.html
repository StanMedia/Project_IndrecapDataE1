The brain implant records signals from the sensorimotor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement. The signals are sent wirelessly to a processing unit that translates them into stimulation patterns. The stimulation patterns are then sent back to the spinal cord implant, which delivers electrical pulses to the nerves that control the leg muscles.</p><p>The system creates a direct communication link between the brain and spinal cord, bypassing the injury site. This allows the person to control their leg movements voluntarily, without any external triggers or preprogrammed patterns.</p><p>The study, published in the journal Nature on May 24, 2023, is the first to demonstrate that a brain-spine interface can restore natural walking ability in a person with paralysis.</p><h2>The remarkable recovery</h2><p>The study involved one participant, Gert-Jan Oskam, a 40-year-old man from the Netherlands who was left paralyzed after a motorbike accident in China more than a decade ago. He had an incomplete spinal cord injury, which means that some nerve fibers were still intact, but not enough to enable movement.</p><p>Oskam had previously received a spinal cord implant that stimulated his leg nerves, but he had to make unnatural heel movements to trigger it. He could only walk on flat surfaces with a walker, and had difficulty starting and stopping.</p><p>He enrolled in the clinical trial of the brain-spine interface in 2020, and underwent surgery to implant the electrodes in his brain. After a few weeks of recovery and calibration, he started training with the system.</p><p>Within a day of training, he was able to walk naturally again, using his own thoughts to control his legs. He could walk at least 100 meters (about 330 feet) on different terrains, such as ramps and stairs. He could also stand without using his hands for a few minutes.</p><p>Oskam said he felt like he had regained control over his body. "Now, I can just do what I want, and when I decide to make a step, the stimulation will kick in," he said at a briefing with journalists. "I have to learn how to walk normal again, like natural, because this is how the system works."</p><p>He said the system was useful in his daily life, such as when he had to paint something by himself. He also hoped that it would improve his health and well-being.</p><h2>The future prospects</h2><p>The researchers behind the study said they were encouraged by Oskam's results, but cautioned that more research was needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of the system. They also said they were working on improving the technology, such as making it smaller and more comfortable.</p><p>They said they planned to enroll more participants with different types of spinal cord injuries in future trials. They also hoped to extend the system to other parts of the body, such as arms and hands.</p><p>The study was led by Dr. Grégoire Courtine and colleagues from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), in collaboration with other institutions in Switzerland, France and China.</p><p>The researchers said they hoped that their work would inspire more innovation and investment in neurotechnology for people with paralysis. They said they believed that restoring natural movement was possible with the right combination of science and engineering.</p><h6>Brain-spine interface, spinal cord injury, paralysis, neurotechnology</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
