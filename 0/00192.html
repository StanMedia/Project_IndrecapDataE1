The vulva includes the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, urethra and vaginal opening. Vulvar itching can be caused by various factors, such as infections, allergies, irritants, skin conditions or hormonal changes. Vulvar itching can interfere with daily activities, sexual function and quality of life.</p><h2>What are the causes of vulvar itching?</h2><p>Some of the possible causes of vulvar itching are:</p><ul><li><p>Irritants: Some products that come in contact with the vulva may contain chemicals that can trigger an allergic reaction or irritation. These include soaps, shower gels, bubble baths, feminine sprays, douches, topical contraceptives, creams, lotions, ointments, detergents, fabric softeners, scented toilet paper and pads. Urine can also cause itching and irritation if there is incontinence.</p></li><li><p>Infections: Some infections that affect the vagina can also cause vulvar itching. These include yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of a fungus called Candida albicans in the vagina. They can cause itching, burning and thick, whitish discharge. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina. It can cause itching, burning and foul-smelling discharge. STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis can cause itching, discharge and pain while urinating.</p></li><li><p>Skin conditions: Some skin conditions that affect other parts of the body can also affect the vulva. These include eczema, psoriasis and vulvar dermatitis. Eczema is a rash that occurs in people with asthma or allergies. It can cause redness, itching and scaly skin on the vulva. Psoriasis is a condition that causes scaly, itchy and red patches on the scalp and joints. It can also affect the vulva in some cases. Vulvar dermatitis is a type of contact dermatitis that occurs when the vulva is exposed to an irritant or allergen.</p></li><li><p>Hormonal changes: Changes in hormone levels during menstruation, pregnancy, menopause or due to certain medications can affect the moisture and pH balance of the vagina and vulva. This can make them more prone to irritation and infection.</p></li></ul><h2>How to treat vulvar itching?</h2><p>The treatment of vulvar itching depends on the underlying cause. Some general tips to soothe vulvar itching are:</p><ul><li><p>Avoid scratching: Scratching can worsen the irritation and inflammation and increase the risk of infection.</p></li><li><p>Keep the area clean and dry: Wash the vulva gently with warm water and a mild cleanser. Avoid using harsh soaps, bubble baths, feminine sprays or douches that can irritate the skin. Pat dry with a soft towel or use a hair dryer on a cool setting.</p></li><li><p>Wear cotton underwear: Cotton underwear can help absorb moisture and prevent friction. Avoid tight-fitting clothes or synthetic fabrics that can trap heat and moisture.</p></li><li><p>Apply a cold compress: A cold compress can help reduce swelling and inflammation and numb the pain.</p></li><li><p>Use over-the-counter medications: Some over-the-counter medications such as antihistamines, hydrocortisone cream or anti-fungal cream can help relieve itching and inflammation caused by allergies or infections.</p></li><li><p>See a doctor: If the vulvar itching is severe, persistent or accompanied by other symptoms such as discharge, bleeding or pain during intercourse or urination, see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. A doctor may prescribe antibiotics for bacterial infections or STIs, anti-fungal medications for yeast infections or steroid creams for skin conditions.</p></li></ul><h2>How to prevent vulvar itching?</h2><p>Some preventive measures to avoid vulvar itching are:</p><ul><li><p>Practice good hygiene: Wash the vulva daily with warm water and a mild cleanser. Change underwear and pads frequently. Wipe from front to back after using the toilet.</p></li><li><p>Avoid irritants: Use unscented products for personal care and laundry. Avoid using feminine sprays or douches that can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina.</p></li><li><p>Use protection during sex: Use condoms or dental dams to prevent STIs that can cause vulvar itching.</p></li><li><p>Manage stress: Stress can affect the immune system and make the vulva more susceptible to irritation and infection. Try to reduce stress by practicing relaxation techniques, exercising, meditating or seeking professional help.</p></li></ul><h6>Vulvar itching, vulva, irritation, infection, yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, STI, eczema, psoriasis, vulvar dermatitis, treatment, prevention</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
