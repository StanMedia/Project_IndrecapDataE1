The water has been treated to remove most radioactive elements, except for tritium, a low-level radioactive hydrogen isotope that is hard to separate from water.</p><p>TEPCO says it is running out of space to store the water, which is currently kept in more than 1,000 tanks on the plant's premises. The government says the only viable option is to gradually release the water into the Pacific Ocean, after further diluting it to meet international safety standards.</p><p>The government and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United Nations body promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, say the controlled release will not harm the environment or human health, as tritium is naturally present in the environment and poses little risk in low concentrations.</p><p>But the plan has sparked fierce opposition from local fishermen, who fear that the release will damage their reputation and livelihood, as well as from neighboring countries and environmental groups, who accuse Japan of violating international law and endangering marine life.</p><h2>The struggle of the fishing industry</h2><p>Fukushima's fishing industry was once a thriving sector that provided Japan with half of its catch. But after the 2011 disaster, radiation from the damaged plant leaked into the sea, prompting authorities to suspend fishing operations off the coast of three prefectures.</p><p>That ban lasted over a year and even after it was lifted, Fukushima-based fishermen were for years mostly limited to collecting samples for radioactivity tests on behalf of TEPCO, rather than taking their catches to market.</p><p>Ocean currents have since dispersed the contaminated water enough that radioactive cesium is nearly undetectable in fish from Fukushima prefecture. Japan lifted its last remaining restrictions on fish from the area in 2021, and most countries have eased import restrictions.</p><p>Fukushima's fishermen have been working hard to restore consumer confidence in their products, by conducting rigorous radiation checks and labeling their catches with origin and safety information. They have also been promoting their fish at local events and online platforms, hoping to attract more customers.</p><p>But their efforts have been hampered by the lingering stigma of the nuclear disaster, as well as by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced demand and disrupted supply chains. A year before the 2011 disaster, government data shows Fukushima's coastal fishing industry landed catches worth around $69 million. By 2018, that figure had dwindled to little more than $17 million. By 2022, while it had recovered somewhat to around $26 million, it was still just a fraction of what it once was.</p><p>Now, with Japan's plan to dump nuclear wastewater into the sea, Fukushima's fishermen fear they will face another setback that could jeopardize their future.</p><p>"I know that the government has decided to go ahead with the policy of releasing treated wastewater into the sea, but for us fishers, it really feels like they made this decision without our full consent," said Kinzaburo Shiga, 77, a third-generation fisherman who operates a trawler at Onahama port. "It makes my blood boil."</p><p>Shiga said he tests his catch for radiation every time he returns from fishing, using a device provided by TEPCO. He said he has never found any abnormal readings in his fish, and he believes they are safe to eat. But he worries that once the water release begins, consumers will shun his products again.</p><p>"We have been working so hard to rebuild our industry and regain trust. But if they release the water, all our efforts will be wasted," he said. "We don't want people to think that Fukushima's fish are contaminated."</p><h2>The controversy over safety</h2><p>Japan's plan to release nuclear wastewater into the sea has drawn criticism from various quarters, both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Some experts have questioned the safety and necessity of the plan, arguing that there are alternative ways to deal with the water problem, such as building more storage tanks or solidifying the water into concrete blocks.</p><p>Some activists have warned that dumping the water could have unforeseen consequences for the marine ecosystem and the food chain, as well as for human health and safety. They have also raised concerns about the lack of transparency and consultation from the Japanese government and TEPCO, and the potential violation of international law and human rights.</p><p>Greenpeace, an environmental group that has been campaigning against the water release, said Japan's plan showed "the government once again failed the people of Fukushima". The group said the government and TEPCO had not fully explored other options, such as building more storage capacity on land or offshore, or disposing of the water through vaporization or solidification.</p><p>The group also said the water release posed "major environmental, health and human rights risks" and could contaminate drinking water sources and seafood. It cited a 2020 study by German oceanographer Georg Steinhauser that suggested that some radioactive isotopes, such as carbon-14, might remain in the water at levels above Japan's legal limits.</p><p>Steinhauser, a professor at Leibniz University Hannover who has been studying the Fukushima disaster since 2011, said his study was based on limited data provided by TEPCO and that more information was needed to assess the actual risks of the water release. He said carbon-14 was a "neglected" radionuclide that could have implications for marine life and human health, as it can be incorporated into organic molecules and enter the food chain.</p><p>He said he was not opposed to the water release in principle, but he urged Japan to be more transparent and accountable about its decision-making process and its safety measures. He also called for more independent oversight and monitoring of the water treatment and release.</p><p>"I think it's not a question of yes or no, but a question of how," he said. "How do you ensure that the water is really clean, that you have removed all the radionuclides that you can remove, and that you have a robust system of verification and control?"</p><h2>The response of the international community</h2><p>Japan's plan to release nuclear wastewater into the sea has also drawn criticism from some of its neighbours, especially China and South Korea, who have accused Japan of disregarding its international obligations and endangering regional security.</p><p>China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Japan had made an "extremely irresponsible" decision that would affect global public interests and Chinese people's health and safety. He said China had expressed "grave concern" to Japan through diplomatic channels and urged Japan to "act in a responsible manner".</p><p>South Korea's foreign ministry said it had summoned Japan's ambassador to Seoul to lodge a formal protest over the plan, which it said posed a "threat" to the marine environment and the health of neighbouring countries. It also said it would raise the issue at international forums such as the United Nations General Assembly and the International Maritime Organization.</p><p>Both China and South Korea have maintained import bans on seafood from Fukushima since 2011, despite Japan's repeated requests to lift them. They have also indicated that they might take legal action against Japan over the water release.</p><p>Japan has defended its plan as a "realistic" and "safe" solution that is based on scientific evidence and endorsed by international experts. It has also stressed that it has been transparent and cooperative with the international community, sharing information and inviting foreign diplomats and media to visit the Fukushima plant.</p><p>Japan's industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said Japan would continue to communicate with other countries and provide "accurate information" to dispel any concerns or misunderstandings. He also said Japan would abide by international rules and standards, and establish a panel of domestic and foreign experts to oversee and verify the water release process.</p><p>The United States, Japan's key ally, has expressed its support for Japan's plan, saying it seemed to have "adopted an approach in accordance with globally accepted nuclear safety standards". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted that Japan had been "transparent about its decision" and that he looked forward to Japan's "continued coordination" with the IAEA.</p><p>The IAEA has also welcomed Japan's plan, saying it was "in line with well-established practices in many nuclear facilities operating around the world". The agency said it would work closely with Japan and other countries to provide technical assistance and independent verification of the water release process.</p><p>The IAEA's director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said Japan had been "transparent about its decision" and that he looked forward to Japan's "continued coordination" with the agency. He also said the IAEA would send a team of experts to Japan later this year to review the plan and its implementation.</p><p>"The Agency will play a vital role in monitoring and reviewing Japan's implementation of its plan. As the eyes and ears of the international community, we will ensure that everything is done properly, safely and without an adverse impact on human health and the environment," Grossi said in a statement.</p><h2>The outlook for the future</h2><p>Japan's plan to release nuclear wastewater into the sea is expected to begin in the summer of 2023, after obtaining regulatory approvals and installing necessary equipment. The government says it will take about 30 years to complete the discharge of all the water stored at the Fukushima plant.</p><p>The water release is part of Japan's long-term strategy to decommission the plant, which is estimated to take up to 40 years and cost about $200 billion. The most challenging task will be removing the melted fuel debris from the reactors, which has not been done before anywhere in the world.</p><p>Japan hopes that by resolving the water issue, it can focus more resources and attention on the fuel debris removal, which is scheduled to start in 2022. The government also hopes that by advancing the decommissioning process, it can revitalize the Fukushima region and support its recovery from the disaster.</p><p>But for Fukushima's fishermen, who have been living with uncertainty and anxiety for more than a decade, the water release plan adds another layer of difficulty to their already precarious situation.</p><p>They say they are not opposed to decommissioning the plant, but they want Japan to consider their voices and interests more seriously. They also want more support from the government and TEPCO to compensate for their losses and help them rebuild their industry.</p><p>"We are not asking for anything unreasonable. We just want to continue fishing and make a living," said Shiga. "We don't want to give up our hope."</p><h6>Fukushima, nuclear wastewater, fishing industry</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
