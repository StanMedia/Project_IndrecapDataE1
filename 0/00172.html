Even though most social media platforms have a minimum age requirement of 13, nearly 40% of kids ages 8 to 12 use them as well.</p><p>The surgeon general issued a new advisory on Tuesday, highlighting the urgent need to understand and address the effects of social media on youth mental health. The advisory notes that social media use can have some benefits, such as connecting with peers, accessing information and expressing creativity, but it also presents "a profound risk of harm" for young users.</p><h2>Social media may cause harm to youth mental health in several ways</h2><p>The advisory reviews the available evidence on how social media may affect the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. It cites studies that found correlations between social media use and depression, anxiety, poor sleep, online harassment and low self-esteem, especially for girls.</p><p>The report also points out that the adolescent years are a critical period for brain development, and that social media use may interfere with cognitive, emotional and social skills. Additionally, the report warns that some social media features, such as likes, comments and notifications, are designed to capture and retain users' attention, creating a risk of addiction and excessive use.</p><p>The advisory acknowledges that there are gaps and limitations in the current research, such as lack of diversity, causality and long-term outcomes. It calls for more rigorous and independent studies to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents.</p><h2>The advisory urges action from multiple stakeholders</h2><p>The surgeon general's advisory is intended to raise awareness and provide recommendations for addressing an urgent public health issue. The report urges action from various stakeholders, including:</p><ul><li>Policymakers: to enact laws and regulations that protect children's privacy, safety and rights online; to fund research and programs that support youth mental health; and to hold technology companies accountable for their practices and policies.</li><li>Technology companies: to design and implement features that promote healthy and safe social media use; to disclose data and cooperate with researchers; and to adhere to ethical standards and best practices.</li><li>Parents and caregivers: to monitor and limit their children's social media use; to model healthy digital habits; and to communicate with their children about online risks and benefits.</li><li>Educators and health professionals: to provide guidance and resources for children and families on how to use social media responsibly; to screen for signs of mental health problems; and to refer to appropriate services when needed.</li><li>Young people: to be mindful of their own social media use; to seek help when they feel overwhelmed or distressed; and to support their peers who may be struggling.</li></ul><p>The advisory comes as the White House announced a new task force on kids and online health and safety on Tuesday. The task force will identify the potential harms posed by online platforms and develop a tool kit for tech companies developing new products.</p><p>The surgeon general said he hopes the advisory will spark a national conversation about social media and youth mental health. He said he wants parents and kids to know that they are not alone in facing this challenge, and that there are steps they can take to protect themselves.</p><h6>Surgeon General, Social Media, Youth Mental Health</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
