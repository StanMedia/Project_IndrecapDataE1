According to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, about 3.1% of Koreans aged 19 to 39 are "reclusive lonely young people", defined as living in a "limited space, in a state of being disconnected from the outside for more than a certain period of time, and have noticeable difficulty in living a normal life". That makes up about 338,000 people across the country, with 40% beginning their isolation in adolescence.</p><p>Various factors are thought to be at play, including financial hardship, mental illness, family problems or health challenges. The ministry said that reclusive youths can have slower physical growth due to irregular living and unbalanced nutrition, and are likely to face mental difficulties such as depression due to loss of social roles and delayed adaptation.</p><p>The phenomenon of social withdrawal is not unique to South Korea. In Japan, it is known as hikikomori, and affects an estimated one million people, mostly young men. Experts have attributed it to the pressures of conforming to a rigid society, as well as the lack of support for those who struggle academically or socially.</p><h2>The government's response</h2><p>In an effort to address this issue, the South Korean government has announced a new measure that will provide a monthly stipend of up to 650,000 Korean won (about $500) to isolated social recluses aged 9 to 24 who earn below the median national income. The stipend is part of the larger Youth Welfare Support Act, which aims to support people extremely withdrawn from society, as well as youths without a guardian or school protection who are at risk of delinquency.</p><p>The youths can apply for the program at a local administrative welfare center; their guardians, counselors or teachers can also apply on their behalf. The stipend will be available in either goods or cash sent to the youth's bank account, or their parents' or grandparents' accounts with their consent. They will not have to prove that they are going outside to continue receiving the money.</p><p>The ministry said that the stipend is intended to support their "psychological and emotional stability and healthy growth", and encourage them to re-enter society by returning to school, looking for jobs, or restoring their daily lives. The ministry also detailed future plans for further action, such as distributing guidelines to local governments, boosting youth social safety nets and early detection systems, and working more closely with youth welfare facilities like shelters or rehabilitation centers.</p><h2>The impact and challenges</h2><p>The ministry's report included several case studies of reclusive youths who benefited from the program. One of them was a 17-year-old who had suffered from domestic violence and hunger at home, making it hard for her to leave the house or form relationships with people outside. She said that after receiving the stipend, she was able to buy food and clothes for herself, enroll in an online high school course, and participate in counseling sessions. She said that she felt more confident and hopeful about her future.</p><p>Another case was a 19-year-old who had dropped out of school due to bullying and academic stress. He had isolated himself at home for three years, playing online games and avoiding contact with anyone. He said that after receiving the stipend, he was able to buy a laptop and a smartphone, which helped him access online education and job information. He also joined a social club for reclusive youths, where he made friends and learned new skills. He said that he was planning to take a college entrance exam next year.</p><p>However, not everyone is optimistic about the effectiveness of the stipend. Some critics have argued that it may create a dependency on government assistance, or incentivize more youths to withdraw from society in order to receive money. Others have pointed out that the stipend alone is not enough to address the root causes of social reclusion, such as poverty, discrimination, or lack of mental health care. They have called for more comprehensive and holistic policies that can tackle these underlying issues and provide long-term solutions.</p><h6>South Korea, social reclusion, youth welfare</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
