India's last census was in 2011 and most recent, scheduled in 2021, was delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The United States is a very distant third, with an estimated population of 340 million, the data, which reflects information available as of February, showed.</p><p>By 2050, eight countries will account for half the projected growth in global population: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania, according to the UNFPA report.</p><p>China has held the distinction of most populous country since at least 1950, when the UN population records began. China and India together will account for more than a third of the estimated global population, which is expected to hit 8.045 billion by mid-year, the UN report said.</p><p>But, contrary to public perception, population growth has been slowing in both countries – particularly in China, which recorded a population decline for the first time in six decades last year.</p><h2>China's population challenge</h2><p>China's population fell in 2022 to 1.411 billion, down some 850,000 people from the previous year, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).</p><p>The birth rate also fell to a record low of 6.77 births per 1,000 people, down from 7.52 a year earlier and the lowest level since the founding of Communist China in 1949.</p><p>China's population decline is partly attributed to its one-child policy that was introduced in 1979 and enforced for more than three decades to curb population growth and boost economic development.</p><p>The policy was relaxed in 2016 to allow couples to have two children, but the change has not reversed the downward trend in births.</p><p>Experts say China faces a demographic crisis that could threaten its economic and social stability. The country is aging rapidly, with a shrinking labor force and a growing number of elderly people who need care and support.</p><p>According to the NBS, China had 264 million people aged 60 or above at the end of 2020, accounting for 18.7% of the total population. The proportion is expected to rise to more than a third by 2050.</p><p>China also has a skewed sex ratio at birth, with 111.3 boys born for every 100 girls in 2020. This is mainly due to a preference for sons and the use of sex-selective abortions under the one-child policy.</p><p>The gender imbalance has resulted in a shortage of marriageable women and a surplus of single men, especially in rural areas. This could pose social problems such as increased crime and violence, as well as psychological stress and loneliness for millions of men.</p><h2>India's demographic dividend</h2><p>India overtaking China will have significant economic implications for both Asian giants.</p><p>Along with the flagging population data, China also reported one of its worst economic growth numbers in nearly half a century last year, underscoring the steep challenges the country faces as its labor force shrinks and the ranks of the retired swell.</p><p>India's working-age population stands at more than 900 million, according to 2021 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This number is expected to hit more than 1 billion over the next decade, according to the Indian government.</p><p>India has a median age of 28.4 years, compared to China's 38.4 years, according to World Bank data. This means India has a large pool of young and productive workers who can potentially drive economic growth and innovation.</p><p>Some experts say India can reap a "demographic dividend" if it can provide adequate education, health care and employment opportunities for its burgeoning population.</p><p>However, others warn that India's population boom could also become a liability if it fails to address the challenges of poverty, inequality, malnutrition, environmental degradation and social unrest.</p><p>India's population is also unevenly distributed across its vast territory, with some states having much higher densities than others. For instance, Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, has a density of 828 people per square kilometer, while Arunachal Pradesh, a northeastern state bordering China, has only 17 people per square kilometer.</p><p>India also has a large rural population, with about 66% of its people living in villages, according to the 2011 census. This poses difficulties for providing adequate infrastructure, health care, education and connectivity for millions of people who lack access to basic amenities and opportunities.</p><p>In contrast, China has become increasingly urbanized in recent decades, with more than 60% of its population living in cities by 2020. China's urbanization has been driven by its export-oriented manufacturing sector, which has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and created a large middle class.</p><p>India has not been able to replicate China's success in industrialization and urbanization, partly due to its complex political system, diverse social structure and democratic norms. India's manufacturing sector accounts for only about 15% of its GDP, compared to more than 25% for China.</p><p>India also faces a huge gender gap in its population, with only 924 females for every 1,000 males, according to the 2011 census. This is mainly due to the preference for sons and the practice of sex-selective abortions in some parts of the country.</p><p>The gender imbalance has resulted in a shortage of women in the marriage market and a surplus of single men, especially in northern India. This could lead to social problems such as violence against women, trafficking and forced marriages.</p><h2>The way forward</h2><p>India's population dynamics present both opportunities and challenges for its development and future prospects.</p><p>On one hand, India has a young and vibrant population that can potentially contribute to economic growth, innovation and social change. India also has a rich and diverse cultural heritage that can enrich its global influence and soft power.</p><p>On the other hand, India needs to address the issues of population pressure, resource scarcity, environmental degradation and social inequality that could hamper its progress and stability.</p><p>To harness its demographic dividend, India needs to invest more in human capital development, especially in education, health care and skill training for its youth. India also needs to create more decent jobs and livelihoods for its working-age population, particularly for women who have lower labor force participation rates than men.</p><p>To manage its population growth, India needs to promote voluntary family planning and reproductive health services for its people. India also needs to combat gender discrimination and violence that affect the lives and well-being of millions of women and girls.</p><p>To cope with its population diversity, India needs to foster social cohesion and harmony among its different religious, ethnic and linguistic groups. India also needs to balance its regional development and urbanization strategies to ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes for all its people.</p><p>India's population is not just a number. It is a reflection of its history, culture and potential. How India shapes its population future will have profound implications for itself and the world.</p><h6>India population growth, China population decline, UNFPA report, demographic dividend, demographic challenge</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
