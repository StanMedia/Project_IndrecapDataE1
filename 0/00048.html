The commander fired missiles at the civilian aircraft twice, "contrary to the order of the command post and other instructions," the court said.</p><p>The other defendants found guilty were personnel of the air defense post, Mehr reported. They received sentences ranging from one to three years in prison .</p><h2>The incident sparked international outrage and criticism</h2><p>The Boeing 737 flight departed from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran on January 8, 2020, and was headed to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv when it was hit by anti-aircraft missiles shortly after takeoff. All 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Canadians, were killed.</p><p>Days after the downing, Iranian authorities admitted that its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force shot the plane down by mistake after it was misidentified as a cruise missile by an air defense operator.</p><p>The incident happened at a time of heightened tensions with the United States, hours after Iran launched ballistic missile strikes on a US base in Iraq – an act of retaliation for the US drone killing of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani.</p><p>Iran faced international pressure and condemnation for its handling of the investigation and the compensation for the victims' families. Several countries, including Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and Britain, formed a group to coordinate their response and seek justice for their citizens who died in the crash.</p><p>Canada's foreign affairs minister said in a statement that "Canada and the other members of the International Coordination and Response Group (CG) are taking a co-ordinated approach to obtaining reparations from Iran, which includes not only compensation for the families but also an accounting of the events that led to the tragic result".</p><h2>The victims' families reject the court's verdict and demand justice</h2><p>The Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims, an international group seeking justice for those killed, released a statement on Sunday saying the victims' families "never recognized the Islamic Regime's court as a legitimate tribunal". It claimed the tribunal had failed to prosecute the "main perpetrators" of the incident, instead prosecuting "ten low-ranking officers with total obscurity of their backgrounds and identities".</p><p>The association condemned the trial as a "sham ruling," after court sessions were held in private, with victims' families not present for hearings. More than 70 complainants from the families of victims had withdrawn their complaints before the sentencing was handed down and rejected the competence of the court, it said.</p><p>The group considers the case still open, and is demanding the dispute be considered by the International Court of Justice.</p><p>Iran's government has pledged to pay $150,000 US to each of the families of the victims . However, some families have said they will not accept any compensation from Iran until those responsible are brought to justice. It is unclear how Iran will deliver the money to the families, especially those who live abroad or have dual citizenship .</p><h6>Iran, Ukraine, Plane crash</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
