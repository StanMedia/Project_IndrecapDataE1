It can cause radiation burns or radiation sickness if mishandled.</p><p>The capsule was being transported from a Rio Tinto mine site north of Newman to Perth for repairs when it apparently fell off a truck between January 11 and January 16. However, its loss was not reported until January 25, when the package containing the capsule was opened and found to be broken.</p><p>The emergency services issued an urgent warning to the public, advising them to stay away from the capsule if they came across it and to seek medical attention if they touched it or were close to it for a long time.</p><p>A multi-agency incident management team, comprising of the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES), the Department of Health, WA Police and other experts, launched a search operation to locate and safely contain the capsule.</p><p>They used GPS data, CCTV footage, witness statements and radiation detection devices to trace the route and stops made by the truck during its journey from Newman to Perth, covering about 1,400km of road.</p><p>They also searched the mine site, the transport depot and other locations where the capsule could have fallen off or been discarded.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, the capsule was finally found 74km south of Newman on the Great Northern Highway by a team from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and DFES.</p><p>The capsule was detected by a radiation monitor mounted on a vehicle that was driving past at 70km per hour. It was located two metres from the side of the road.</p><p>A 20-metre "hot zone" was set up around the capsule to ensure the public's safety and it was placed into a lead container. The capsule will be stored at a secure location in Newman overnight before being transported to a WA Health Department facility on Thursday where it will be examined.</p><h2>The capsule's potential risks and impacts</h2><p>Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope that is produced by nuclear fission. It has a half-life of about 30 years, meaning it takes that long for half of its atoms to decay. It emits beta particles and gamma rays, which can penetrate human tissue and damage cells.</p><p>According to ANSTO, caesium-137 is widely used in industrial applications such as gauges, well logging devices and medical equipment. It is also used as a source of radiation for sterilization, food preservation and cancer treatment.</p><p>However, caesium-137 can also pose serious health risks if it is not handled properly or if it leaks into the environment. Exposure to high levels of caesium-137 can cause acute radiation syndrome, which can result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding, infections, organ failure and death.</p><p>Exposure to lower levels of caesium-137 can increase the risk of developing cancer over time. Caesium-137 can also contaminate soil, water and food sources if it is released into the environment.</p><p>The missing capsule that prompted an emergency warning over a 1,400km stretch of Western Australia. (Supplied: DFES)</p><p>The missing capsule that sparked the search operation had a radiation level of about 800 microsieverts per hour at one metre distance, according to DFES. This is equivalent to about 80 times the normal background radiation level in Australia.</p><p>DFES Country North chief superintendent David Gill said that anyone who touched or went close to the capsule for more than an hour could have received a significant dose of radiation.</p><p>He said that anyone who had any concerns about their exposure should contact their doctor or call Health Direct on 1800 022 222.</p><p>He also said that in the unlikely event that the capsule had leaked, the area around where it was found would be remediated.</p><h2>The capsule's implications and lessons</h2><p>The loss and recovery of the radioactive capsule has raised questions about the safety and security of transporting hazardous materials in Western Australia.</p><p>WA Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said that he had asked DFES to conduct a review of the incident and report back to him with recommendations on how to prevent such incidents from happening again. He also said that he had asked the Radiological Council, the regulatory body for radiation safety in WA, to investigate whether there had been any breaches of the Radiation Safety Act or the Radiation Safety Regulations by the parties involved in the transportation of the capsule.</p><p>He said that he expected Rio Tinto and the transport company to cooperate fully with the investigations and to provide any information or assistance required.</p><p>He also said that he was pleased with the outcome of the search operation and thanked all the agencies and personnel involved for their efforts and professionalism.</p><p>"This is an extraordinary result. The search crews have quite literally found the needle in the haystack," he said at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>"I do want to emphasise that this was a very complex and challenging operation. It involved a large area of land, a long period of time and a very small object."</p><p>He also thanked the public for their cooperation and vigilance during the search operation and urged them to remain alert for any suspicious or unusual items.</p><p>"If you see something that looks out of place or potentially dangerous, do not touch it or pick it up. Report it immediately by calling 13 DFES (13 33 37)," he said.</p><h2>The capsule's use and purpose</h2><p>The radioactive capsule that caused the search operation is a type of device that is widely used in industrial applications, especially in the mining, oil and gas sectors. It contains a small amount of caesium-137, a radioactive isotope that emits beta particles and gamma rays.</p><p>Caesium-137 is used as a source of radiation for measuring the density and flow of materials and fluids in pipes, tanks, wells and other structures. It can also be used for sterilization, food preservation and cancer treatment.</p><p>The capsule is part of a radiation gauge that consists of a source holder, a detector and a display unit. The source holder contains the capsule and shields it from the environment. The detector measures the amount of radiation that passes through the material or fluid being measured. The display unit shows the density or flow rate of the material or fluid.</p><p>The radiation gauge works by emitting gamma rays from the capsule that penetrate through the pipe or tank wall and the material or fluid inside. The detector on the opposite side of the pipe or tank receives the gamma rays and converts them into an electrical signal. The signal is proportional to the density or flow rate of the material or fluid.</p><p>The radiation gauge can provide accurate and reliable measurements without requiring physical contact with the material or fluid. This can reduce the risk of contamination, corrosion or damage to the pipe or tank. It can also save time and money by avoiding the need for sampling, laboratory analysis or manual inspection.</p><p>The radiation gauge is designed to be safe and secure when used properly. The capsule is enclosed in a steel casing that prevents beta particles from escaping. The source holder has a locking mechanism that prevents unauthorized access to the capsule. The radiation gauge has a warning label and a sign that indicate the presence of radiation.</p><p>However, if the capsule is damaged, lost or stolen, it can pose serious health and environmental risks. Exposure to high levels of caesium-137 can cause acute radiation syndrome, which can result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding, infections, organ failure and death. Exposure to lower levels of caesium-137 can increase the risk of developing cancer over time. Caesium-137 can also contaminate soil, water and food sources if it is released into the environment.</p><h6>Radioactive capsule, Western Australia, caesium-137, search operation, public health</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
