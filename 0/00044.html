The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.</p><p>According to the prosecution, Csergo had been in contact with two people he suspected to be agents of China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) since 2021, when they approached him through LinkedIn.</p><p>The pair, identified only as "Ken" and "Evelyn", allegedly paid Csergo in envelopes of cash to write handwritten reports on various topics related to Australia's defence, economic and diplomatic arrangements.</p><p>These topics included the AUKUS pact, a new security alliance between Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom that involves sharing nuclear submarine technology; the QUAD partnership, a strategic dialogue among Australia, the US, India and Japan; and Australia's mining of lithium and iron ore, two key resources for China's economy.</p><p>Csergo is alleged to have travelled back to Australia earlier this year with a "shopping list" of intelligence priorities requested by Ken and Evelyn. The list was discovered by ASIO three weeks after his arrival.</p><p>Csergo also allegedly continued to communicate with Ken via WeChat, a popular Chinese social media app, and invited him to visit Australia.</p><p>The prosecution argued that Csergo had close ties to China, where he had lived and worked for decades, and that he posed a flight risk and a threat to national security.</p><p>The defence lawyer, Bernard Collaery, a prominent barrister who has represented whistleblowers and human rights activists, challenged the strength of the case against Csergo.</p><p>He claimed that the reports Csergo had written were based on publicly available information and that his client had cooperated with the authorities.</p><p>He also suggested that Csergo was a victim of changing political circumstances, as he had been encouraged and praised for developing business relationships in China before the foreign interference law was passed.</p><p>He said that Csergo was an experienced and successful businessman who had suffered reputational damage and career ruin as a result of the charge.</p><p>On Monday, Magistrate Michael Barko denied bail to Csergo, saying that he was a "sophisticated, worldly businessperson" who had been on the radar of ASIO for some time before his arrest.</p><p>He said that the prosecution had a strong case against Csergo and that there were concerns for his safety if he were released.</p><p>He also said that Csergo had shown a high level of anxiety and was in "survival mode" when he met Ken and Evelyn in Shanghai cafes and restaurants that had been cleared of other customers.</p><p>Csergo appeared in court via video link from Parklea Prison where he is being held as a high security prisoner. His mother and brother were in court.</p><p>He is due to appear again in court on June 16.</p><h2>What is AUKUS and why is it important?</h2><p>AUKUS is a new trilateral security pact between Australia, the UK and the US, announced on 15 September 2021 for the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>Under the pact, the US and the UK will assist Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines, which are faster, stealthier and have longer range than conventional ones.</p><p>The pact also includes cooperation on advanced cyber mechanisms, artificial intelligence and autonomy, quantum technologies, undersea capabilities, hypersonic and counter-hypersonic weapons, electronic warfare, innovation and information sharing.</p><p>The pact will focus on military capability, separating it from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance that also includes New Zealand and Canada.</p><p>The pact is seen as a significant strategic move to counter China's growing influence and assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, where it has been expanding its military presence and activities in disputed areas such as the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.</p><p>The pact also reflects a shift in Australia's defence posture from relying on diesel-electric submarines to acquiring nuclear-powered ones, which will enhance its interoperability with the US and the UK and increase its deterrence and defence capabilities.</p><p>The pact also marks the first time the US has shared nuclear propulsion technology with an ally apart from the UK, signalling a deepening of trust and cooperation among the three countries.</p><p>The pact has been welcomed by other allies such as Japan, India and South Korea, but has drawn criticism and condemnation from China, which accused the three countries of having a "cold-war mentality" and undermining regional peace and stability.</p><p>The pact also angered France, which lost a lucrative contract to build 12 conventional submarines for Australia as a result of the deal. France recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the US, calling the pact a "stab in the back" and a "betrayal" of trust.</p><p>The pact has been described by some analysts as the most significant security arrangement between the three countries since World War Two, and as a major shift in the geopolitical landscape of the Indo-Pacific region.</p><h6>AUKUS, QUAD, China, Australia, foreign interference</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
