He told lawmakers in the Commons that the sites would be scaled up to hold several thousand migrants.</p><p>The minister added that the government was also "continuing to explore the possibility of accommodating migrants in vessels as they are in Scotland and in the Netherlands."</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab also told Sky News on Wednesday the government will consider housing migrants on barges to deter from the "perverse incentive" of hotel accommodation.</p><p>The contracted use of hotels was envisioned as a temporary measure, but adds strain to the asylum accommodation system. The cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels has increased over the past year, now exceeding £6 million ($7.4 million) a day, the Home Office told CNN in a statement.</p><p>Jenrick said "the sheer number of small boats have overwhelmed the asylum system" and said the government would "not elevate the wellbeing of illegal migrants above the British people."</p><p>"Accommodation for migrants should meet essential living needs and nothing more, because we cannot risk becoming a magnet for the millions of people who are displaced and seeking better economic prospects," he added.</p><p>Jenrick said the three new sites will help reduce the need to rely on private hotels but conceded that "these sites on their own will not end the use of hotels overnight."</p><p>He also revealed barracks at Catterick Garrison in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency was being assessed for suitability as potential accommodation.</p><p>Later, bosses of a commercial port on the Dorset coast in southern England said the Home Office had asked it to provide space for an "accommodation facility". Bill Reeves, chief executive of Portland Port, said: "We are currently liaising with the Home Office about the next steps." Conservative-led Dorset Council has said it has "serious concerns" about the location.</p><p>There had been media speculation the government could announce plans to use vessels to house migrants, but it wasn't included in what the minister called the "first tranche" of housing options.</p><p>The government says £6.2m a day is being spent on hotels for migrants and areas with high concentrations of people face a strain on local services. The BBC understands more than 51,000 people are currently being housed in 395 hotels. Jenrick said new funding would be made available for local authorities to help deal with costs.</p><h2>The criticism and opposition</h2><p>The plan has been met with fierce criticism from human rights advocates, opposition parties and some local authorities, who have condemned it as "cruel", "inhumane" and "unworkable".</p><p>Mary Atkinson, the campaigns and networks manager at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, told CNN: "All of us deserve safety, and the chance to be part of a community – especially people who have faced unimaginable struggles and are rebuilding their lives in the UK. (This) is yet another ploy by this government to … distract from the real issues affecting our communities."</p><p>Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, tweeted on Wednesday: "Time and again Tories chase headlines instead of doing the hard work to go after smuggler gangs, clear the backlog (of asylum claims), reform resettlement and family reunion and get a new agreement (with) France to stop dangerous crossings undermining our border security and putting lives at risk."</p><p>Stephen Morgan MP, Labour's shadow armed forces minister, said: "This is an admission of failure by this Tory government. They have failed to tackle illegal immigration or deal with asylum claims fairly or efficiently. Now they are planning to house vulnerable people fleeing war zones in disused military bases."</p><p>He added: "This is not only cruel but unworkable. It will not deter people from seeking asylum in the UK, but it will make their lives more miserable and precarious. It will also create more problems for the local authorities and communities who have to deal with the consequences of this ill-thought-out policy."</p><p>The plan has also been denounced by some human rights organisations and charities, who have raised concerns about the impact of the plan on the mental and physical health of asylum seekers, as well as their access to legal and social support.</p><p>Steve Valdez-Symonds, refugee and migrant rights programme director at Amnesty International UK, said: "This is a shameful proposal that shows a complete disregard for the dignity and humanity of people seeking safety in the UK."</p><p>He said: "People who have fled war and persecution deserve respect and compassion, not to be dumped in squalid and unsuitable accommodation that puts their health and wellbeing at risk."</p><p>He added: "The government should focus on creating a fair and effective asylum system that upholds people's rights and enables them to rebuild their lives in safety, rather than pursuing these cruel schemes that will only cause more harm and suffering."</p><p>Nick Harrop, media manager at Freedom from Torture, a charity that supports survivors of torture, said: "Many of the people we work with have experienced horrific abuse in their home countries, and have made dangerous journeys to reach safety in the UK. They need care and support, not to be treated like criminals and locked up in barracks or boats."</p><p>He said: "These plans are not only inhumane, but also counterproductive. They will make it harder for people to access legal advice, healthcare and other essential services. They will also increase the risk of re-traumatisation, isolation and mental health problems among people who have already suffered enough."</p><p>He added: "The government should abandon these plans and instead provide safe and dignified accommodation for asylum seekers, as well as investing in a faster and fairer asylum process that gives people a chance to rebuild their lives in peace."</p><h6>UK, migrants, military bases, vessels</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
