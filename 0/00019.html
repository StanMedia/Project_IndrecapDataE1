China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary.</p><p>Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned to China in 1997, enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle. However, Beijing has been tightening its grip on the city's freedoms and institutions, especially after the 2019 anti-government protests that rocked the city.</p><p>China has repeatedly denounced any foreign interference or criticism of its policies on Taiwan and Hong Kong, accusing other countries of violating its sovereignty and internal affairs.</p><h2>Lu Shaye's controversial remarks</h2><p>On April 21, Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye delivered a speech at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI), where he discussed China's relations with Europe and the world.</p><p>In his speech, Lu said that China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, and expects other countries to do the same for China.</p><p>However, he also made some controversial remarks that sparked outrage among some European countries, especially those that were formerly part of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Lu said that some European countries have a "double standard" when it comes to China's sovereignty issues. He said that while they support China's territorial claims over Tibet and Xinjiang, two regions that have faced allegations of human rights abuses and cultural genocide by Beijing, they do not recognize China's claims over Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p><p>He also questioned whether some former Soviet republics, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which are now members of the European Union and NATO, have the right to exist as independent states.</p><p>He said: "Some people say that Taiwan is not part of China. But what about the Baltic states? Are they part of Russia? After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many former Soviet republics declared independence. But did they have a legal basis for doing so?"</p><p>He added: "Some people say that Hong Kong is not part of China. But what about Crimea? Is it part of Ukraine or Russia? After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Crimea became part of Ukraine. But did it have a legal basis for doing so?"</p><p>Lu's remarks drew sharp reactions from several European countries and institutions, who condemned his statements as unacceptable and provocative.</p><h2>European reactions</h2><p>The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania issued a joint statement on April 22, expressing their "deep concern" over Lu's remarks. They said that Lu's comments were "an attempt to falsify history and question the sovereignty" of their countries.</p><p>They said: "The Baltic states are sovereign and independent countries since 1918. The occupation and illegal annexation by the Soviet Union was never recognized by most democratic countries. The restoration of independence in 1990-1991 was based on international law."</p><p>They also reaffirmed their support for Taiwan and Hong Kong's democracy and human rights, and called on China to respect the "one country, two systems" principle for Hong Kong.</p><p>They said: "We stand in solidarity with Taiwan and Hong Kong whose sovereignty is being challenged by China. We support their legitimate aspirations for democracy and human rights. We urge China to respect the 'one country, two systems' principle for Hong Kong as agreed in the Sino-British Joint Declaration."</p><p>The European Union also expressed its solidarity with the Baltic states, and rejected Lu's remarks as "unfounded" and "regrettable".</p><p>A spokesperson for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on April 23: "The EU fully supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The EU does not recognize any changes to borders by force or coercion."</p><p>The spokesperson also said that the EU supports a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues between China and Taiwan in accordance with international law. He said: "The EU has a strong interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The EU encourages dialogue between China and Taiwan."</p><p>France, which hosts Lu as its ambassador, also expressed its displeasure over his comments. French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on April 23 that Lu's remarks were "unacceptable" and "contrary to international law". He said that France summoned Lu to the ministry to express its "disapproval" and "expectations".</p><p>He said: "France fully supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Ukraine. France does not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia. France also supports a peaceful and constructive dialogue between China and Taiwan."</p><h2>China's response</h2><p>China has not officially responded to the European reactions, but Lu defended his remarks on Twitter on April 24. He said that he was only expressing his personal views and did not intend to offend anyone.</p><p>He said: "I respect the choice of the people of the Baltic states and other former Soviet republics. I was only expressing my personal understanding of international law and history. I did not mean to hurt anyone's feelings."</p><p>He also said that he hopes that China and Europe can have more exchanges and dialogues on various issues, and enhance mutual understanding and trust.</p><p>He said: "China and Europe are partners, not rivals. We should respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and avoid interference in each other's internal affairs. We should also promote cooperation on global challenges such as climate change, pandemic prevention and control, and economic recovery."</p><h2>Analysis</h2><p>Lu's remarks have raised eyebrows among observers, who wonder why he made such provocative statements at a time when China is trying to improve its image and influence in Europe.</p><p>Some analysts say that Lu may have been trying to draw a parallel between China's claims over Taiwan and Hong Kong, and Russia's claims over Crimea and other parts of Ukraine. By questioning the legitimacy of some former Soviet states, he may have been implying that China has a stronger case for its sovereignty issues than Russia.</p><p>However, this strategy may have backfired, as it has alienated many European countries that are already wary of China's growing assertiveness and human rights record. It may also have undermined China's efforts to present itself as a mediator and a responsible power in the Ukraine crisis.</p><p>Some analysts say that Lu may have been following the instructions of Beijing, which may have wanted to test the waters and gauge the European reactions to his remarks. By doing so, China may have been trying to assess the level of European support for Ukraine and the Baltic states, as well as the degree of European unity and coordination on foreign policy issues.</p><p>However, this tactic may have also backfired, as it has provoked a strong and united response from the European countries and institutions, who have reaffirmed their solidarity with Ukraine and the Baltic states, and their rejection of any changes to borders by force or coercion.</p><h6>China, Europe, Baltic states, Ukraine, Lu Shaye</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
