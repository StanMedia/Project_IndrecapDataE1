The deal, which also includes spending cuts and policy changes, was hailed by both leaders as a compromise that would ensure the government's ability to pay its bills and fund its programs.</p><p>However, the deal also faced criticism from lawmakers and analysts who questioned its impact on the economy, the budget, and the environment. Some Republicans accused McCarthy of caving in to Biden's demands and failing to rein in spending. Some Democrats accused Biden of sacrificing vital programs and undermining his own agenda. And some investors expressed skepticism about the deal's ability to address the long-term fiscal challenges facing the US.</p><h2>What's in the deal?</h2><p>Under the deal, the debt limit would be suspended until the first quarter of 2025, beyond the 2024 elections. Rather than raising the debt ceiling by a specific dollar amount, suspending it allows Congress to define a period of time before the debt limit would need to be addressed again.</p><p>The deal also includes a two-year budget deal that would hold spending flat for 2024 and impose limits for 2025. That's in exchange for raising the debt limit for two years, until after the next election. It also expands some work requirements for food-stamp recipients and tweaks an environmental law to try to streamline reviews to build new energy projects.</p><p>To reduce spending, as Republicans had insisted, the package includes a two-year budget deal that would hold spending flat for 2024 and impose limits for 2025. That's in exchange for raising the debt limit for two years, until after the next election. It also expands some work requirements for food-stamp recipients and tweaks an environmental law to try to streamline reviews to build new energy projects.</p><p>Among other things, the agreement would cut about $10 billion out of the $80 billion that Biden previously secured to help the I.R.S. go after wealthy tax cheats, and would use that money to preserve domestic programs that otherwise would have been cut.</p><h2>What's not in the deal?</h2><p>The deal does not include any new revenue sources or tax increases, which Democrats had sought to pay for their ambitious social spending and climate change plans. It also does not address some of the key drivers of the national debt, such as entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.</p><p>The deal also does not include any measures to prevent future debt ceiling crises, which have become a recurring source of political brinkmanship and economic uncertainty. Some experts have called for abolishing or reforming the debt ceiling altogether, arguing that it serves no useful purpose and only creates unnecessary risks.</p><h2>How did the markets react?</h2><p>The news of the deal initially boosted market confidence, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that a default was avoided. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 200 points on Monday morning, while Treasury yields fell slightly.</p><p>However, some analysts warned that the deal was only a temporary fix that did not address the underlying fiscal problems facing the US. They also pointed out that the deal could face resistance from some lawmakers who may try to block or amend it before it becomes law.</p><p>Some investors also expressed concern that the deal could lead to higher inflation and interest rates in the future, as the government continues to borrow and spend more than it collects in revenue. They also worried that the deal could undermine Biden's ability to pass his $3.5 trillion spending package, which he hopes will boost economic growth and competitiveness.</p><h6>Debt ceiling, Budget deal, Market reaction</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
