Gen. William Jurney, the commander of US Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, in a statement.</p><p>"Together we are strengthening our capabilities in full-spectrum military operations across all domains," Jurney said.</p><p>Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the exercise demonstrated the strong bond and mutual trust between the two allies.</p><p>"This is a testament to our unwavering commitment to defend our sovereignty and uphold our shared values," Lorenzana said.</p><p>Marcos, who was joined by his defense and armed forces chiefs, boarded and inspected a HIMARS cab displayed at the San Antonio naval base before observing the exercise through binoculars and on a TV screen.</p><p>He smiled when the first missile was fired, leaving a trail of smoke in the sky.</p><h2>The exercise came amid rising tensions with China in the region</h2><p>The Balikatan exercises come amid warming relations between the US and the Philippines following the election of Marcos Jr, who has sought to develop closer ties with Washington in contrast to his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who tilted toward China.</p><p>The US and the Philippines have maintained a mutual defense treaty since 1951, but under Duterte the Philippines downplayed longstanding territorial disputes with Beijing while seeking to attract investment.</p><p>The Balikatan exercises also follow the announcement that the Philippines will grant increased access by US forces to bases in the archipelago under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Arrangement (EDCA).</p><p>The four bases joined five included earlier, including three on Luzon close to Taiwan, and one on Balabac Island close to Chinese installations on disputed islands in the South China Sea.</p><p>China has criticized the military exercises, which come against the backdrop of what the Philippines calls "aggressive" Chinese actions in the South China Sea.</p><p>Beijing has said that it has indisputable sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and has built artificial islands with military facilities on some of them. It has also accused the US of meddling in regional affairs and militarizing the waters.</p><p>The US has said that it does not take sides in territorial disputes but supports freedom of navigation and overflight in accordance with international law. It has also conducted regular naval and aerial patrols to challenge China's claims and reassure its allies and partners.</p><h6>US, Philippines, South China Sea, military exercise, China</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
