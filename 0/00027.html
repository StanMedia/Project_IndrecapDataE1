He amassed a fortune estimated at $30 billion and built a private zoo on his ranch in Colombia, where he imported exotic animals such as elephants, giraffes, zebras and hippos.</p><p>After his death in 1993, most of his animals were relocated to other zoos or wildlife reserves, but not the hippos. They were too large and difficult to transport, so they were left behind on his estate, known as Hacienda Napoles. There, they thrived in the warm and wet climate, reproducing rapidly and expanding their territory along the Magdalena River basin.</p><h2>The problem of the "cocaine hippos"</h2><p>Today, there are between 130 and 160 hippos in Colombia, making it the largest population outside Africa. They have been dubbed "cocaine hippos" by the media, as a reminder of their origin and their impact on the environment.</p><p>Hippos are not native to South America and have no natural predators there. They consume large amounts of vegetation and produce huge amounts of waste, which affects the water quality and oxygen levels in rivers and lakes. This can harm fish and other aquatic species, as well as human health.</p><p>Hippos are also dangerous animals that can weigh up to four tons and run up to 30 kilometers per hour. They are aggressive and territorial, especially when defending their young or their mates. They have been known to attack humans and livestock, causing injuries and deaths.</p><h2>The solution of relocation</h2><p>Colombia has tried various methods to control the hippo population over the years, such as culling, castration and contraception. However, these have proven ineffective or controversial, as hippos are difficult to catch and sterilize, and some people oppose killing them on ethical grounds.</p><p>In March 2023, the Colombian government announced a new plan to relocate 70 of the hippos to sanctuaries in Mexico and India, where they will be cared for and prevented from breeding. The plan is part of a deal signed with various institutions, including the Colombian Agricultural Institute, the Colombian Air Force and the Ostok Sanctuary in Mexico.</p><p>The relocation process will cost approximately $3.5 million, according to officials. It will involve luring the hippos with bait into pens, confining them in special crates and transporting them by air. The process is expected to take place by the end of June 2023, after the Ministry of Environment issues "hippo passports" for each animal.</p><p>The plan has been welcomed by some environmentalists and animal rights activists, who see it as a humane and sustainable way to deal with the hippo problem. However, some experts have raised concerns about the feasibility and safety of moving such large and unpredictable animals across continents.</p><h2>The future of Escobar's hippos</h2><p>Even if the relocation plan succeeds, it will not eliminate all of Escobar's hippos from Colombia. There will still be around 60 to 90 hippos left in the wild, which could continue to multiply and spread. One study estimated that by 2034, there could be up to 1,400 hippos in Colombia.</p><p>Therefore, authorities will need to monitor and manage the remaining hippos, using a combination of strategies such as sterilization, vaccination and education. They will also need to work with local communities to raise awareness about the risks and benefits of living with hippos, and to promote coexistence and conservation.</p><p>Escobar's hippos are a unique case of an invasive species that has become part of Colombia's culture and identity. They are a reminder of the country's violent past, but also a symbol of its resilience and diversity.</p><h6>Pablo Escobar, cocaine hippos, Colombia, relocation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
