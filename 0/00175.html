The fine is the largest of its kind, and accompanies an order to stop data transfers to the US within six months.</p><p>The decision by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which oversees Meta's operations in Europe, is the culmination of a long-running legal battle that began in 2013, when Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems filed a complaint against Facebook for sharing his data with US intelligence agencies under the PRISM program revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>Schrems argued that Facebook's data transfers violated his fundamental rights under EU law, which grants citizens a high level of data protection and privacy. He also challenged the legal mechanisms that Facebook and other companies used to justify their data transfers, such as the Privacy Shield agreement and the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).</p><p>The Privacy Shield was a framework that allowed companies to self-certify their compliance with EU data protection standards when transferring data to the US. It was struck down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2020, following a lawsuit by Schrems, who claimed that it did not provide adequate safeguards against US government surveillance.</p><p>The SCCs are contractual agreements between data exporters and importers that oblige them to respect EU data protection rules. They are still valid under EU law, but the ECJ ruled that they must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the legal regime of the third country where the data is transferred.</p><p>The DPC's decision is based on this ruling, which found that US law does not offer sufficient protection for EU data subjects against US surveillance activities. The DPC said that Meta failed to demonstrate that it had conducted an adequate assessment of the risks involved in transferring data to the US, and that it had not implemented any supplementary measures to mitigate those risks.</p><p>Meta said it would appeal the decision, calling it "unprecedented" and "disproportionate". The company also said it would challenge the legal basis of the DPC's order to suspend its data transfers to the US, which it said would have "far-reaching consequences" for its business and users.</p><p>Meta's appeal will be heard by the Irish High Court, which may refer some questions to the ECJ. The process could take several years, during which Meta can continue its data transfers until a final judgment is issued.</p><h2>Implications for transatlantic relations</h2><p>The DPC's decision is not only a blow for Meta, but also a sign of growing tensions between Europe and the United States over data privacy, government surveillance and regulation of internet platforms.</p><p>The EU has long been critical of US surveillance practices, which it considers incompatible with its fundamental rights and values. The EU has also been more proactive than the US in enacting strict rules for digital companies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p><p>The US, on the other hand, has accused the EU of being protectionist and discriminatory towards American tech giants, which dominate the global digital market. The US has also expressed concerns about the impact of EU regulations on innovation and competitiveness.</p><p>The DPC's decision could further strain transatlantic relations, as it affects thousands of businesses that rely on transferring data from Europe to America. According to a 2019 study by the US Chamber of Commerce and BSA | The Software Alliance, more than 70% of EU-US trade depends on cross-border data flows.</p><p>The decision could also hamper cooperation between Europe and America on other issues, such as trade, security and climate change. The Biden administration has been trying to rebuild trust and partnership with Europe after four years of hostility under Trump. However, the DPC's decision could undermine these efforts and create new obstacles for dialogue and collaboration.</p><h2>Possible solutions and alternatives</h2><p>Both sides have acknowledged the need to find a lasting solution for transatlantic data transfers that respects EU privacy standards and US national security interests. However, reaching such a solution is not easy, as it requires legal and political changes on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>One possible solution is to negotiate a new agreement to replace the Privacy Shield, which was invalidated by the ECJ. The EU and the US have been in talks since last year to develop a new framework that would address the concerns raised by the court. However, the talks have been slow and difficult, as the US has been reluctant to make any concessions on its surveillance powers.</p><p>Another possible solution is to reform US surveillance laws to limit their scope and provide more safeguards and remedies for EU data subjects. The US has already taken some steps in this direction, such as passing the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act in 2018, which allows foreign governments to request data from US companies under certain conditions. However, the EU has argued that these steps are not enough, and that more fundamental changes are needed.</p><p>A third possible solution is to reduce the reliance on data transfers and store more data locally or in regions that have similar data protection standards as the EU. This could be done by using encryption, anonymization or other technical measures to protect data from unauthorized access. However, this solution could also have drawbacks, such as increasing costs, reducing efficiency and creating fragmentation in the digital market.</p><p>Meta has said it is exploring all these options and working with regulators and policymakers to find a way forward. However, it remains unclear whether any of these solutions will be acceptable and feasible for both parties, and whether they will be implemented in time to avoid further legal action and disruption.</p><h6>Meta, EU, US, privacy, data, fine</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
