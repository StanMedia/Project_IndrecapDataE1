It is one of the most dangerous and inhospitable regions in the world, with no roads, no infrastructure, and no government presence. It is also home to armed groups, drug traffickers, wild animals, and tropical diseases.</p><p>The Darien Gap is the only break in the Pan-American Highway, a network of roads that connects Alaska to Argentina. For many migrants who want to reach North America, crossing the Darien Gap is the only option.</p><h2>Why are children crossing the Darien Gap?</h2><p>According to UNICEF, almost 9,700 children and adolescents have tried to cross the Darien Gap in the first two months of 2023, a seven-fold increase compared to the same period in 2022. The majority of them are from Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela, and several African countries.</p><p>These children and their families are fleeing violence, poverty, persecution, and instability in their countries of origin. They hope to find safety and opportunity in the United States or Canada. However, they face many risks and challenges along the way.</p><p>UNICEF says that crossing the Darien Gap can take up to seven days on foot, depending on the weather and the physical condition of the migrants. Many of them carry only a backpack with some clothes, food, and water. They have to walk through muddy trails, cross rivers, climb mountains, and sleep in makeshift camps.</p><p>Some of them get lost, injured, robbed, or attacked by armed groups or wild animals. Some of them die of exhaustion, dehydration, or disease. Some of them are separated from their families or travel alone.</p><h2>What is UNICEF doing to help?</h2><p>UNICEF and its partners are supporting national efforts to protect the rights and needs of migrant children and families in transit through Panama. They provide humanitarian supplies, health care, water and sanitation services, child protection services, and psychosocial support.</p><p>UNICEF also advocates for safe and legal pathways for migration, as well as for more investment in addressing the root causes of forced displacement in the countries of origin.</p><p>UNICEF Representative for Panama Kyungsun Kim said: "The dramatic increase in the number of migrant children moving through the Darien Gap underscores the urgent need for action to protect these children and ensure their access to essential services such as health and water and hygiene. This requires coordinated and strengthened efforts from governments and humanitarian actors on the ground responding to the unpredictable flow of children on the move and their needs."</p><h6>Darien Gap, UNICEF, migrant children</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
