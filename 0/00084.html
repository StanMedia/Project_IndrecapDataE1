A club of mostly ex-Soviet states, the SCO includes Russia and China, as well as other major economic players such as India and Pakistan. The kingdom could eventually be granted full membership.</p><p>China's growing role in the Middle East of late has alarmed Washington. This month alone, Beijing mediated a landmark agreement between archfoes Iran and Saudi Arabia that could help significantly ease Middle East tensions. Saudi Arabia also significantly strengthened its energy ties with China by announcing on Monday a $3.6 billion deal to buy 10% of China's Rongsheng Petrochemical, which would see it supply 480,000 barrels per day of crude oil to the company.</p><p>Analysts say that as the US' rivalry with China and Russia intensifies in an increasingly polarized world, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations are choosing to diversify their global partnerships. But while states like Saudi Arabia may be getting closer to China, Beijing is far from becoming a US rival in the region, they say.</p><p>"The traditional monogamous relationship with the US is now over," said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst and writer. "And we have gone into a more open relationship; strong with the US but equally strong with China, India, (the) UK, France and others."</p><p>That polarization is the reason different parties "bring different forms of influence to the table," he told CNN. "The smart thing for the kingdom is to put in place a portfolio of strategic relations that all contribute to its security and prosperity in different ways."</p><p>The kingdom's ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, told CNN's Becky Anderson in October that a review of the US-Saudi relationship was "a positive thing."</p><p>"This kingdom is not the kingdom it was five years ago, it's not the kingdom it was 10 years ago. So, every piece of analysis that existed is no longer relevant," she said, stressing nonetheless that the alliance with the US was wide-ranging and robust.</p><p>Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson on Thursday, Vali Nasr, professor of Middle East studies and international affairs at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), said the US needs to rethink its Middle East policy "because it has been based on a very different conception of Saudi Arabia."</p><h2>China's economic interests in the Middle East</h2><p>Analysts, however, say that the Middle East is unlikely to become an arena for US-Chinese rivalry, given Beijing's economy-oriented focus and its aversion to playing regional politics. The Saudi-China relationship is therefore unlikely to become a full-blown alliance.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is China's biggest supplier of crude, and China is the biggest destination of Saudi oil exports. The two countries have also signed several agreements on trade, investment, infrastructure, energy and technology under China's Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p>China has also cultivated ties with other Middle Eastern countries such as Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Israel, seeking to balance its interests and avoid taking sides in regional disputes. Unlike the US, China has not intervened militarily or diplomatically in conflicts such as Syria, Yemen or Libya.</p><p>"China does not want to be seen as a political actor in this region," said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Programme. "It wants to be seen as an economic actor that can provide opportunities for development and growth."</p><p>Vakil said that China's approach to the Middle East is pragmatic and flexible, adapting to changing circumstances and opportunities. She added that China does not seek to replace the US as a security provider or a political mediator in the region.</p><p>"China does not have an ideological agenda in this region," she said. "It does not have a vision for what this region should look like politically or socially."</p><h2>The US-Saudi alliance under strain</h2><p>The US-Saudi alliance has been under strain since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 by agents of the Saudi government. The Biden administration has vowed to recalibrate its relations with Riyadh, suspending arms sales and ending support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.</p><p>The US has also sought to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, which Saudi Arabia opposes. The deal would limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 by agents of the Saudi government. The Biden administration has vowed to recalibrate its relations with Riyadh, suspending arms sales and ending support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.</p><p>The US has also sought to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, which Saudi Arabia opposes. The deal would limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed harsh sanctions on Tehran, triggering a cycle of escalation and retaliation in the region.</p><p>The Biden administration has said it wants to engage Saudi Arabia on regional security issues, such as countering Iran's influence and supporting a political solution in Yemen. It has also expressed concern over human rights violations and repression of dissent in the kingdom.</p><p>In February, the US released an intelligence report that held Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for approving the operation that killed Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post columnist who was critical of the Saudi regime. The US also imposed sanctions on some of the individuals involved in the murder, but stopped short of directly targeting the crown prince.</p><p>The US-Saudi alliance, which has endured through seven Saudi monarchs and 15 presidents, has taken a blow under US President Joe Biden, who vowed during his campaign in 2019 to make the oil-rich Gulf nation a "pariah" for the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 and the kingdom's role in the punishing Yemeni civil war.</p><h2>The implications for regional stability and global order</h2><p>The shifting dynamics of the US-Saudi alliance have implications for regional stability and global order. On one hand, some experts argue that the US should not abandon its longstanding partner in the Middle East, especially as it faces threats from Iran and other actors. They warn that pushing Saudi Arabia away could undermine US interests and influence in the region, and create a vacuum that could be filled by China or Russia.</p><p>On the other hand, some experts contend that the US should not turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses and destabilizing actions, such as its intervention in Yemen, its blockade of Qatar, and its crackdown on dissidents. They advocate for a more balanced and conditional approach that holds Saudi Arabia accountable for its behavior and encourages reforms.</p><p>The challenge for the Biden administration is to find a way to balance its values and interests, while maintaining a constructive dialogue with Saudi Arabia on issues of mutual concern. The challenge for Saudi Arabia is to adapt to a changing international environment, where it can no longer rely on unconditional US support or ignore global norms and expectations.</p><p>The future of the US-Saudi alliance will depend on how both sides manage these challenges and opportunities, and how they navigate their relations with other regional and global powers. The outcome will have significant consequences for peace, security, and prosperity in the Middle East and beyond.</p><h6>US-Saudi alliance, China-Middle East relations, Iran nuclear deal</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
