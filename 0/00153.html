They recruited a network of co-conspirators who sold them their winning lottery tickets at 10-20% of their actual value, instead of claiming the prizes from the lottery commission.</p><p>This allowed the real winners to avoid identification by the commission, which is required to withhold outstanding taxes, back taxes and child support payments before paying out the prizes. The Jaafars then cashed the tickets as their own and lied on their tax returns to dodge more than $6 million in federal taxes.</p><p>The Jaafars cashed more than 14,000 lottery tickets between 2011 and 2019 as part of the scheme and claimed over $20.9 million in proceeds that were not reported on their tax returns. In 2019, Ali Jaafar was the top individual lottery ticket casher for the state, while Mohamed Jaafar was the third-highest and Yousef Jaafar was the fourth-highest.</p><p>The Jaafars also pocketed at least $1.2 million of the government's lost tax money as their profit from the scheme.</p><h2>How they were caught and convicted</h2><p>The scam came to light in 2019 when the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission noticed a suspicious pattern of frequent and large cashing activity by the Jaafars. The commission alerted the IRS and launched an investigation that uncovered the extent of the fraud.</p><p>The Jaafars were indicted in 2021 on charges of conspiracy to defraud the IRS, conspiracy to commit money laundering and filing a false tax return. Ali and Yousef Jaafar were convicted by a jury in December 2021 after a two-week trial. Mohamed Jaafar pleaded guilty in November 2021 and is awaiting sentencing in July.</p><p>U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton sentenced Ali Jaafar to five years and Yousef Jaafar to 50 months in prison on Monday. He also ordered them to pay over $6 million in restitution and forfeit their profits from the scheme.</p><p>"This case is, at its core, an elaborate tax fraud. Over the course of a decade, this father-and-son team defrauded the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission and the IRS to pocket millions of hard-earned taxpayers' dollars," said Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy in a statement.</p><p>"These defendants worked together to recruit a wide network of co-conspirators and spread their lottery scam across Massachusetts, avoiding detection by repeatedly lying to government officials," he added.</p><h2>What are the consequences and implications of the scam</h2><p>The scam not only deprived the government of its rightful revenue, but also harmed legitimate lottery winners who sold their tickets at a discount and missed out on their full prizes.</p><p>The scam also undermined the integrity and fairness of the lottery system, which is designed to benefit public education and local aid in Massachusetts.</p><p>The scam also exposed the vulnerability of the lottery system to fraud and abuse by unscrupulous individuals who exploit loopholes and gaps in oversight.</p><p>The case has prompted calls for reforms and improvements in the lottery system, such as requiring more identification and verification for cashing tickets, imposing limits on cashing frequency and amount, enhancing data analysis and monitoring, and increasing cooperation among law enforcement agencies.</p><p>"This case is an example of the extensive efforts the Lottery will take in partnering with law enforcement to assist in the prevention of illegal activities. This decision is the culmination of years of hard work to maintain the integrity of the Lottery," said Deborah B. Goldberg, state treasurer &amp; receiver general and chair of the lottery commission.</p><h6>Lottery scam, ten-percenting, tax fraud, money laundering, Massachusetts</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
