The pact is the product of months-long discussions between officials from both countries and reflects their "ironclad" alliance.</p><p>One of the key elements of the agreement is a new US commitment to deploy a nuclear-armed submarine in South Korea for the first time since the early 1980s. A US official said that the US intends to "take steps to make our deterrence more visible through the regular deployment of strategic assets, including a US nuclear ballistic submarine visit to South Korea."</p><p>The official also clarified that such assets will not be stationed permanently, and there is "no plan" to deploy any tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula. The agreement also says that the US will give South Korea more insight into its nuclear planning over any conflict with North Korea.</p><p>Biden said that the agreement demonstrates the "unwavering" commitment of the US to defend South Korea and maintain peace and stability in the region. He also issued a stark warning to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying that any nuclear attack by North Korea against the US and its allies will result in the end of his regime.</p><h2>Kim Yo Jong condemns the agreement as a hostile act</h2><p>On Friday, April 29, 2023, North Korea's state-run KCNA published a statement by Kim Yo Jong, the sister of Kim Jong Un and a powerful figure in the country's leadership. She slammed the US-South Korea security pact as a "typical product of their extreme anti-North Korean hostile policy, reflecting the most hostile and aggressive will of action."</p><p>She said that the agreement will only result in making peace and security of northeast Asia and the world be exposed to more serious danger, and it is an act that can never be welcomed. She accused Biden of making a "nonsensical remark from the person in his dotage" by threatening to end her brother's regime. She also labeled Yoon as a "fool" for signing the pact.</p><p>She warned that North Korea will not remain silent in the face of such provocations and will take corresponding measures to defend its sovereignty and dignity. She said that North Korea has enough power and means to counter any threat from the US and South Korea.</p><p>Her statement marks the first response North Korea has made to the security pact. It also signals a continuation of North Korea's hardline stance towards its rivals, despite recent signs of diplomatic engagement.</p><h2>Implications and challenges of the agreement</h2><p>The US-South Korea security pact is seen as a significant step in strengthening their alliance and deterring North Korea from pursuing its nuclear and missile programs. It also reflects Biden's strategy of working closely with allies to address regional challenges and counter China's growing influence.</p><p>However, the agreement also poses some challenges and risks for both sides. For South Korea, it may increase domestic opposition from some groups who oppose hosting US military assets or engaging in a nuclear arms race with North Korea. It may also complicate South Korea's efforts to resume dialogue and cooperation with North Korea, which has been stalled since 2019.</p><p>For the US, it may escalate tensions with China, which views any increase in US military presence in its backyard as a threat to its interests and security. It may also invite more provocations from North Korea, which may test its new weapons or launch cyberattacks to demonstrate its capabilities and defiance.</p><p>The agreement also raises questions about how effective it will be in deterring North Korea, which has shown no signs of giving up its nuclear arsenal or changing its behavior. Some experts argue that deterrence alone is not enough, and that dialogue and diplomacy are also needed to address the root causes of the conflict and find a peaceful solution.</p><h2>Kim Yo Jong's role and influence in North Korea</h2><p>Kim Yo Jong is the youngest child of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and his consort, Ko Yong Hui. She is also the younger sister of Kim Jong Un, the current supreme leader and general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).</p><p>She studied with her elder brothers at a public school in Bern, Switzerland, under an assumed name from 1996 to 2000. She then returned to Pyongyang and completed a degree in computer science at Kim Il Sung University.</p><p>She began her political career in 2007 as a junior cadre in the WPK, likely working under her father or her aunt, Kim Kyong Hui. She was active in establishing her father's hereditary succession campaign, also working in the National Defense Commission and in her father's personal secretariat.</p><p>She rose to prominence after her father's death in 2011, when she appeared alongside Kim Jong Un and led groups of senior party officials in bowing at her father's casket. She became one of her brother's most trusted confidantes and advisers, often accompanying him on his public appearances and foreign trips.</p><p>She currently serves as the deputy department director of the Publicity and Information Department of the WPK, which oversees propaganda, media, and ideological education. She is also an alternate member of the Politburo of the WPK, the highest decision-making body of the party. Since September 2021, she has also served as a member of State Affairs Commission of North Korea, the only woman on the panel.</p><p>She is widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in North Korea's political system, with some commentators speculating that she could be a possible successor to Kim Jong Un if he were to die or become incapacitated. She has also been involved in inter-Korean relations and diplomacy with the United States, often issuing statements or delivering messages on behalf of her brother.</p><p>She has shown a mix of charm and toughness in her public persona, sometimes smiling and waving at foreign dignitaries or crowds, and sometimes lashing out at North Korea's enemies or critics. She has been described as intelligent, ambitious, charismatic, ruthless, and loyal to her brother.</p><h6>Kim Yo Jong, US-South Korea security pact, nuclear submarine, deterrence</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
