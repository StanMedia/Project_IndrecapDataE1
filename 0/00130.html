It enables US authorities to prosecute individuals involved in "doping schemes for the purpose of influencing international sports competitions", including those who have not previously been governed by sport anti-doping rules.</p><p>The law applies to competitions that involve US athletes, sponsors or broadcasters, or that receive federal funding. It also allows whistleblowers to seek damages from those who retaliate against them for exposing doping activities.</p><p>The law has been praised by US anti-doping officials and athletes as a powerful tool to deter and punish those who cheat and harm clean sport. It has also been supported by Rodchenkov himself, who now lives in hiding in the US after fleeing Russia.</p><p>"This conviction is a watershed moment for international sport. Lira provided banned performance-enhancing substances to Olympic athletes who wanted to corruptly gain a competitive edge," said Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who announced Lira's guilty plea.</p><p>"Such craven efforts to undermine the integrity of sport subverts the purpose of the Olympic Games: to showcase athletic excellence through a level playing field. Lira's efforts to pervert that goal will not go unpunished."</p><p>Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), said: "Without this law, Lira, who held himself out as a doctor to athletes, likely would have escaped consequence for his distribution of dangerous performance-enhancing drugs and his conspiracy to defraud the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games because he did not fall under any sport anti-doping rules."</p><h2>The athletes who were caught using Lira's drugs</h2><p>One of the athletes who received drugs from Lira was Blessing Okagbare, a Nigerian sprinter who won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and was a medal contender for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p><p>Okagbare was expelled from the Tokyo Games just before the women's 100m semi-finals after it emerged she had tested positive for human growth hormone in an out-of-competition test in Slovakia before the delayed 2020 Games.</p><p>She denied knowingly taking any banned substance and claimed she was sabotaged by someone close to her. She also said she had eaten beef in Nigeria before travelling to Slovakia, suggesting it could have been contaminated with hormones.</p><p>However, according to court documents seen by CNN, Lira had supplied Okagbare with human growth hormone and other drugs via WhatsApp messages and mail deliveries. He also instructed her on how to use them and how to avoid detection.</p><p>Lira also provided drugs to Alex Wilson, a Swiss sprinter who was born in Jamaica and competed for Switzerland at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Wilson tested positive for trenbolone, an anabolic steroid, in an out-of-competition test in March 2021.</p><p>He claimed he had eaten contaminated beef while visiting his partner's family in Jamaica. He appealed his suspension and was initially cleared to compete at the Tokyo Games, but his ban was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after an appeal by World Athletics and WADA.</p><p>According to court documents seen by CNN, Lira had supplied Wilson with trenbolone and other drugs via WhatsApp messages and mail deliveries. He also instructed him on how to use them and how to avoid detection.</p><h2>The impact of doping on the integrity and fairness of sport</h2><p>The use of performance-enhancing drugs by Olympic athletes is not a new phenomenon, but it has become more sophisticated and widespread in recent years, posing a serious threat to the integrity and fairness of sport.</p><p>Performance-enhancing drugs are substances that can improve an athlete's physical or mental abilities, such as strength, speed, endurance, concentration, or recovery. They can be natural or synthetic, and can include hormones, steroids, stimulants, blood boosters, masking agents, and gene doping.</p><p>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is the global organization that oversees the fight against doping in sport. It maintains a list of prohibited substances and methods that are banned from Olympic competition and other international events. It also conducts testing and investigations to detect and deter doping violations.</p><p>However, WADA faces many challenges in its mission, such as the emergence of new and undetectable drugs, the lack of resources and cooperation from some countries and sports federations, the corruption and manipulation of anti-doping systems by state actors or criminal networks, and the pressure and incentives for athletes to cheat.</p><p>One of the most notorious examples of doping in Olympic history was the Russian state-sponsored doping scheme that corrupted several Olympic Games and other international competitions from 2011 to 2015. The scheme involved the systematic manipulation of urine samples, the tampering of laboratory equipment and data, the cover-up of positive tests, and the protection of doped athletes.</p><p>The scheme was exposed by Rodchenkov, who was the former director of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory and a key player in the conspiracy. He fled to the US in 2016 and became a whistleblower, revealing the details of the scheme in a documentary called "Icarus" and in testimony to various authorities.</p><p>As a result of his revelations, WADA declared Russia non-compliant with its anti-doping code and imposed sanctions on its participation in international events. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also banned Russia from competing as a nation at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, although some Russian athletes were allowed to compete as neutrals under strict conditions.</p><p>The RADA was partly inspired by Rodchenkov's story and aimed to strengthen the US's ability to prosecute those who facilitate doping at international events. The law also seeks to protect whistleblowers like Rodchenkov from retaliation and to encourage more cooperation among countries and organizations in combating doping.</p><p>The law has been welcomed by many anti-doping advocates and athletes who believe it will deter and punish those who cheat and harm clean sport. However, it has also faced some criticism from some quarters who argue that it could create legal conflicts with other jurisdictions, undermine WADA's authority and independence, or violate athletes' rights.</p><h2>The future of anti-doping efforts in sport</h2><p>The case of Lira is the first test of the RADA's effectiveness and impact on anti-doping efforts in sport. It shows that the US is serious about holding accountable those who supply banned substances to Olympic athletes and that it will not tolerate any attempts to undermine the integrity of sport.</p><p>However, it also raises questions about how the law will be applied in other cases involving different actors, such as coaches, doctors, officials, or sponsors. It also remains to be seen how other countries will react to the law and whether they will cooperate or resist its enforcement.</p><p>Moreover, it is clear that doping is not a problem that can be solved by one law or one country alone. It requires a global and coordinated response that involves all stakeholders in sport: athletes, coaches, officials, federations, governments, media, sponsors, fans, and anti-doping agencies.</p><p>It also requires a culture change that values fair play over winning at all costs, that respects the health and rights of athletes over commercial interests or political agendas, and that rewards honesty over deception.</p><p>Only then can sport truly fulfill its potential as a force for good in society.</p><h2>The challenges and opportunities for anti-doping efforts in sport</h2><p>The use of performance-enhancing drugs by Olympic athletes poses a serious challenge to the anti-doping efforts in sport, as it undermines the integrity and fairness of competition and jeopardizes the health and rights of athletes.</p><p>However, it also presents an opportunity for anti-doping efforts to improve and innovate, by developing new methods and technologies to detect and deter doping, by enhancing the education and awareness of athletes and the public about the risks and consequences of doping, and by fostering a culture of ethics and values in sport that respects the spirit of Olympism.</p><p>One of the methods that has been used to combat doping in sport is the biological passport, which is an electronic record of an athlete's biological markers over time. The biological passport can detect changes in an athlete's blood or urine profile that may indicate the use of banned substances or methods.</p><p>Another method that has been used to combat doping in sport is the whistleblower program, which encourages and protects individuals who report doping violations or provide information that can assist anti-doping investigations. The whistleblower program can help expose doping schemes that may otherwise remain hidden or undetected.</p><p>A third method that has been used to combat doping in sport is the intelligence and investigations unit, which collects and analyzes information from various sources, such as testing results, whistleblowers, law enforcement agencies, media reports, or social media platforms. The intelligence and investigations unit can help identify doping trends, patterns, networks, or targets for further action.</p><p>These methods are examples of how anti-doping efforts in sport have evolved and adapted to the changing nature and challenges of doping. However, they also require more resources, cooperation, and coordination among different stakeholders in sport, such as athletes, coaches, officials, federations, governments, media, sponsors, fans, and anti-doping agencies.</p><p>Moreover, they also require more transparency, accountability, and independence in the governance and management of anti-doping systems, as well as more respect for the rights and responsibilities of athletes in the anti-doping process.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of anti-doping efforts in sport depends on the commitment and collaboration of all those who are involved in or affected by sport. It also depends on the recognition and appreciation of the values and principles that underpin sport, such as excellence, respect, friendship, solidarity, diversity, inclusion, and fair play.</p><p>These values and principles are not only essential for sport, but also for society at large. They can inspire and empower people to pursue their goals and dreams with integrity and dignity. They can also foster a sense of belonging and community among people from different backgrounds and cultures.</p><p>By promoting these values and principles through sport, anti-doping efforts can contribute to a more peaceful and sustainable world.</p><h6>doping, Olympics, RADA, anti-doping</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
