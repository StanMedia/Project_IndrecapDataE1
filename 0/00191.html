Some studies have found that personality compatibility or similarity can predict relationship satisfaction and longevity, while others have found no or weak effects.</p><p>Some of the factors that may account for these inconsistencies include the use of different personality models, measures and methods; the influence of other variables such as age, gender and culture; and the complexity and dynamics of human relationships.</p><p>The current study adds to the existing literature by using a large and diverse sample of couples; a comprehensive and validated measure of personality; a novel measure of emotional fluctuations; and sophisticated statistical analyses.</p><p>However, the study also has some limitations, such as the reliance on self-reported data; the cross-sectional design that does not capture changes over time; and the lack of information on other aspects of relationship quality such as communication, intimacy and conflict.</p><p>Therefore, future research is needed to replicate and extend the findings using longitudinal, experimental and observational methods; incorporating other measures of relationship quality; and examining potential moderators and mediators of the effects of personality and emotional fluctuations on relationship outcomes.</p><h6>Emotional stability, Personality traits, Relationship satisfaction, Relationship commitment</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
