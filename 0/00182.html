Dr. Liu Bo-ren: Start from Walking</h1><p><img src=https://a1.indrecap.com/0/00182.webp height=281 class=antiCLS /></p><p class=imgCredit>Jose Antonio Alba/Pixabay</p><p>A functional medicine expert shares his advice on how walking and other forms of exercise can benefit cancer patients and survivors.</p><h2>The Benefits of Walking for Cancer Patients and Survivors</h2><p>Walking is a simple and effective form of exercise that can improve cardiovascular health, activate the brain, and optimize mood. A study involving 60-80 year olds found that walking for at least 150 minutes per week for 12 weeks resulted in lower levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and arterial stiffness, as well as higher levels of glutathione, an antioxidant enzyme, and lower levels of malondialdehyde, a free radical marker. These findings suggest that walking can have significant health benefits for older adults (J Environ Public Health. 2022 Jan 31;2022:5942947).</p><p>Walking can also help cancer patients and survivors cope with depression, anxiety, and stress, especially if they walk in a forest. A study that examined how a short walk in a forest affected the psychological state of 585 young adults found that walking in a forest for about 15 minutes significantly reduced negative emotions such as sadness, depression, tension, anxiety, anger, fatigue, confusion, and hostility. This result indicates that walking, especially in a forest, can have a great impact on psychological resilience and rehabilitation (Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2018 Dec 10;15:2804).</p><h2>The Role of Forest Therapy in Enhancing Immunity</h2><p>Forest therapy is a practice of spending time in nature to improve physical and mental health. It can enhance immunity by exposing the body to negative ions and phytoncides, two substances that are abundant in forests.</p><p>Negative ions are air molecules that carry a negative charge. They can bind with dust and pollutants in the air and make them fall to the ground. They can also activate cells, improve brain cortex function, and regulate autonomic nervous system disorders.</p><p>Phytoncides are volatile organic compounds that plants release to protect themselves from bacteria, fungi, insects, and animals. They include limonene from coniferous forests and linalool from camphor forests. They have effects such as stabilizing mood, reducing airway inflammation, and lowering blood pressure.</p><p>A study that involved 12 healthy men aged 37-55 who participated in a three-day trip to three different forests found that 91% of them showed higher natural killer cell activity after the trip, with an average increase of about 50% (Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2007 Apr-Jun;20:3-8). Natural killer cells are immune cells that can destroy tumor cells and virus-infected cells.</p><p>Forest therapy can also increase the production of anti-cancer proteins such as perforin, granzyme A and B, and granulysin (Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2008 Jan-Mar;21:1-9). These proteins can induce apoptosis or programmed cell death in tumor cells.</p><p>Therefore, combining exercise with forest therapy can have synergistic effects on boosting immunity and preventing cancer recurrence.</p><h2>The Advantages of Slow Jogging at Home</h2><p>If weather or air pollution prevents outdoor activities, slow jogging at home is a good alternative. Slow jogging is a form of aerobic exercise that can maintain muscle strength and even increase muscle mass.</p><p>A Japanese exercise scientist designed a slow jogging program that involved 90 minutes of slow jogging and 90 minutes of walking per week for 12 weeks. He asked older adults with an average age of 70 to follow this program and assessed its impact on their skeletal muscle mass, body fat composition, and physical fitness. He found that those who did slow jogging had reduced thigh fat, increased aerobic capacity, and increased muscle mass. He recommended this simple exercise to the public (Eur J Appl Physiol. 2017 Jan;117:7-15).</p><p>The trick to slow jogging is simple: take about 160 to 180 steps per minute. You can use a metronome app on your smartphone to keep pace. You can jog in place or move forward. Your feet should not be lifted too high. When you land on the ground, your forefoot should touch first, followed by your heel. Your knees should be slightly bent.</p><p>Slow jogging has many advantages: it is easy to perform, it does not cause breathlessness, it is not limited by space or time, and it can be done while watching TV. It is very suitable for people who do not like exercise.</p><p>One of the author's female patients had been troubled by diabetes, obesity, and high triglycerides for a long time. He asked her to do slow jogging for 40 minutes every day while watching TV. As a result, she lost 6 kilograms in three months, her hemoglobin A1C dropped from 8.5 to 7.4, and her triglycerides dropped from 320mg/dl to 180mg/dl. She was very happy and continued to do slow jogging. Her husband also followed her example and lost his belly fat. His chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease also improved without medication.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Exercise is an important part of cancer prevention and recovery. It can improve physical and mental health, enhance immunity, and reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Walking is a simple and effective form of exercise that can be done by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Forest therapy can add to the benefits of walking by exposing the body to negative ions and phytoncides, which can boost natural killer cell activity and anti-cancer proteins. Slow jogging is another option for indoor exercise that can increase muscle mass and reduce body fat. No matter what type of exercise you choose, the key is to do it regularly and enjoy it.</p><h6>Exercise, Cancer, Walking, Forest Therapy, Slow Jogging</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
