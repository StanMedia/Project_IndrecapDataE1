The local and regional bodies would be based on existing organisations or networks, and would reflect the diversity and aspirations of Indigenous communities.</p><p>The co-design groups also proposed that the Voice should have a set of principles to guide its functions and operations, such as cultural authority, independence, accountability, transparency, inclusiveness, accessibility, and responsiveness.</p><h2>Government's response and opposition's stance</h2><p>The government welcomed the co-design report and announced its intention to hold a referendum on the Voice in 2023. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that constitutional recognition was "a matter of national importance" and "a step towards reconciliation".</p><p>He also revealed the proposed question and amendment for the referendum, which were drafted in consultation with a First Nations Referendum Working Group. The question would ask voters: "A Proposed Law: To alter the Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration?" The amendment would insert a new chapter into the constitution that would state: "Chapter IX Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples 129 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice".</p><p>The government introduced the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill 2022 in December 2022, which would enable the holding of the referendum and provide funding for public education and information campaigns. The bill also included provisions for appointing official yes and no committees, which would receive equal amounts of public funding to advocate their positions.</p><p>The opposition supported the bill and expressed its backing for the Voice referendum. Opposition leader Scott Morrison said that he was "proud to stand with Indigenous Australians" and "committed to delivering constitutional recognition". He also praised the co-design process as "inclusive and respectful" and urged Australians to vote yes in the referendum.</p><h2>Public opinion and challenges ahead</h2><p>According to opinion polls conducted in late 2022 and early 2023, a majority of Australians support constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians and the establishment of a Voice. However, some polls also indicate that many voters are still undecided or unaware of the details of the proposal.</p><p>Some of the challenges that may affect the outcome of the referendum include:</p><ul><li>The complexity and novelty of the proposal, which may require more explanation and education to inform voters about its implications and benefits.</li><li>The timing and context of the referendum, which may coincide with other political events or issues that could distract or influence voters' attention or preferences.</li><li>The level of bipartisanship and consensus among political parties, Indigenous leaders, Indigenous organisations, and civil society groups, which could affect the level of trust and legitimacy of the proposal.</li><li>The potential for misinformation and disinformation campaigns, which could spread false or misleading claims about the proposal or its consequences.</li><li>The constitutional threshold for a successful referendum, which requires a double majority of both a majority of voters nationally and a majority of voters in a majority of states.</li></ul><h2>Implications and significance</h2><p>If the referendum is successful, it would be a historic moment for Australia and its Indigenous peoples, who have never been formally recognised in the constitution or had a guaranteed voice in the political system.</p><p>It would also be a rare achievement in Australian constitutional history, as only eight out of 44 referendums have been carried since federation in 1901. The last successful referendum was in 1999, when voters approved the insertion of a preamble into the constitution to acknowledge the service of Australians in defence of their country.</p><p>The Voice would be a new and unique institution in Australian democracy, which could potentially enhance the representation, participation, and empowerment of Indigenous Australians. It could also foster a more respectful and constructive relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, based on mutual recognition and dialogue.</p><p>However, if the referendum fails, it would be a major setback for the aspirations and expectations of Indigenous Australians, who have been calling for constitutional recognition for decades. It would also raise questions about the future of reconciliation and the viability of other proposals for treaty-making or truth-telling.</p><h6>Australia, referendum, Indigenous Voice, constitution, recognition</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
