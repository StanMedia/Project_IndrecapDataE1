People with ASD may have difficulties with communication, social interaction, and behavior. They may also have restricted and repetitive interests or activities.</p><p>ASD is not a single disorder, but a spectrum that includes different levels of severity and symptoms. Some people with ASD may have mild impairments and high intelligence, while others may have severe challenges and intellectual disabilities. ASD can also co-occur with other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, or epilepsy.</p><p>ASD is found in people of all races, ethnicities, cultures, and economic backgrounds. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1 in 54 children in the United States have ASD, with boys being four times more likely than girls to be diagnosed.</p><h2>What are the signs of autism spectrum disorder?</h2><p>The signs of ASD typically appear in early childhood, between 12 and 24 months of age. However, some signs may be noticeable earlier or later. The signs may vary depending on the age, severity, and type of ASD.</p><p>Some common signs of ASD include:</p><ul><li>Reduced eye contact or lack of response to their name</li><li>Difficulty expressing or understanding emotions, gestures, or facial expressions</li><li>Delayed or absent speech or language skills</li><li>Repetitive or unusual speech patterns, such as echolalia (repeating words or phrases)</li><li>Preference for playing alone or retreating into their own world</li><li>Resistance to physical contact or cuddling</li><li>Lack of interest in sharing their interests or activities with others</li><li>Difficulty making friends or maintaining relationships</li><li>Lack of empathy or awareness of others' feelings or perspectives</li><li>Inflexibility or resistance to change in routines or environments</li><li>Repetitive or stereotyped behaviors, such as rocking, flapping, spinning, or lining up objects</li><li>Intense or obsessive interests in specific topics or objects</li><li>Sensory sensitivities or aversions to certain sounds, smells, textures, tastes, or lights</li></ul><p>No single sign is definitive of ASD, and no two people with ASD have identical symptoms. Therefore, it is important to seek a professional evaluation if there are any concerns about a child's development.</p><h2>What causes autism spectrum disorder?</h2><p>The exact causes of ASD are not fully understood, but research suggests that both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Some possible causes include:</p><ul><li>Genetic mutations or variations that affect brain development and function</li><li>Family history of ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders</li><li>Exposure to certain toxins, infections, medications, or maternal stress during pregnancy</li><li>Premature birth or low birth weight</li><li>Advanced parental age at the time of conception</li></ul><p>However, there is no evidence that ASD is caused by vaccines, parenting styles, diet, or emotional trauma.</p><h2>What are the types of autism spectrum disorder?</h2><p>In the past, ASD was classified into different subtypes based on the symptoms and severity. These subtypes included:</p><ul><li>Autistic disorder (also known as classic autism), which involved significant impairments in communication and social interaction, as well as repetitive behaviors and interests.</li><li>Asperger's syndrome (also known as high-functioning autism), which involved milder impairments in social interaction and communication, but no significant delays in language or cognitive development.</li><li>Childhood disintegrative disorder (also known as Heller's syndrome), which involved a normal development until at least age 2, followed by a dramatic loss of skills in language, social interaction, and behavior.</li><li>Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) (also known as atypical autism), which involved some but not all of the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger's syndrome.</li></ul><p>However, in 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) replaced these subtypes with a single diagnosis of ASD, with three levels of severity based on the level of support needed:</p><ul><li>Level 1: Requiring support. People with level 1 ASD may have difficulties initiating and maintaining social interactions, following social rules and conventions, and organizing and planning their activities. They may also have inflexible or narrow interests and behaviors that interfere with their functioning.</li><li>Level 2: Requiring substantial support. People with level 2 ASD may have more severe difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication, social interaction, and behavior. They may also have more frequent and intense repetitive behaviors and interests that limit their ability to cope with change or diversity.</li><li>Level 3: Requiring very substantial support. People with level 3 ASD may have very limited or absent communication skills, minimal social interaction, and extreme difficulty coping with change or diversity. They may also have very repetitive and restrictive behaviors and interests that interfere with their daily life.</li></ul><p>The DSM-5 also allows for the specification of associated features or conditions, such as intellectual impairment, language impairment, medical conditions, or environmental factors.</p><h2>How is autism spectrum disorder diagnosed?</h2><p>There is no single test for diagnosing ASD. The diagnosis is based on a comprehensive evaluation of the person's communication, social interaction, behavior, and developmental history. The evaluation may involve:</p><ul><li>A screening tool, such as the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), which is a questionnaire that parents or caregivers can fill out to identify possible signs of ASD in children aged 16 to 30 months.</li><li>A developmental assessment, which is a series of tests and observations that measure the person's cognitive, language, motor, social, and emotional skills.</li><li>A behavioral observation, which is a structured or naturalistic observation of the person's behavior and interaction in different settings and situations.</li><li>A diagnostic interview, which is a structured or semi-structured interview with the person and their parents or caregivers to gather information about their symptoms, history, strengths, and challenges.</li><li>A medical examination, which may include blood tests, genetic tests, brain scans, or other tests to rule out or identify any medical conditions that may be related to ASD or affect the treatment.</li></ul><p>The evaluation may be conducted by a team of professionals from different disciplines, such as pediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, or special educators.</p><p>The diagnosis of ASD can be made as early as 18 months of age, but some cases may not be detected until later in childhood or adulthood. Early diagnosis and intervention can improve the outcomes and quality of life for people with ASD and their families.</p><h2>How is autism spectrum disorder treated?</h2><p>There is no cure for ASD, but there are various treatments and interventions that can help people with ASD improve their skills, reduce their challenges, and enhance their well-being. The treatments and interventions may include:</p><ul><li>Behavioral therapy, which involves teaching positive behaviors and reducing negative behaviors using principles of learning and motivation. Examples of behavioral therapy include applied behavior analysis (ABA), pivotal response treatment (PRT), early start Denver model (ESDM), and discrete trial training (DTT).</li><li>Developmental therapy, which involves fostering the person's social, emotional, cognitive, and communication development using naturalistic and play-based methods. Examples of developmental therapy include the DIR/Floortime model, the Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) program, and the Social Communication/Emotional Regulation/Transactional Support (SCERTS) model.</li><li>Educational therapy, which involves providing individualized and specialized instruction and support to help the person achieve their academic and functional goals. Examples of educational therapy include individualized education programs (IEPs), special education services, and inclusive education practices.</li><li>Speech-language therapy, which involves improving the person's verbal and nonverbal communication skills using various strategies and techniques. Examples of speech-language therapy include augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, picture exchange communication system (PECS), and social stories.</li><li>Occupational therapy, which involves enhancing the person's daily living and adaptive skills using various activities and exercises. Examples of occupational therapy include sensory integration therapy, fine motor skills training, and self-care skills training.</li><li>Physical therapy, which involves improving the person's gross motor skills and physical fitness using various exercises and equipment. Examples of physical therapy include balance training, coordination training, and strength training.</li><li>Medication therapy, which involves prescribing medications to treat some of the symptoms or co-occurring conditions associated with ASD, such as anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, or aggression. Examples of medication therapy include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics, stimulants, and mood stabilizers.</li><li>Complementary and alternative therapies, which involve using non-conventional methods to supplement or replace conventional treatments. Examples of complementary and alternative therapies include dietary interventions, vitamin supplements, herbal remedies, acupuncture, and music therapy.</li></ul><p>The treatments and interventions for ASD should be tailored to the person's needs, preferences, strengths, and goals. They should also be based on scientific evidence and professional guidance. The effectiveness of the treatments and interventions should be monitored and evaluated regularly.</p><h2>Where can I find more information and support?</h2><p>If you or someone you know has ASD or suspects having ASD, you are not alone.
