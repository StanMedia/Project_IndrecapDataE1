In an interview with POLITICO Europe, Macron said that Europe should not become "just America's followers" when asked about the prospect of China invading Taiwan.</p><p>"The question Europeans need to answer ... is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No. The worse thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the US agenda and a Chinese overreaction," Macron said, adding that Europe must not get "caught up in crises that are not ours, which prevents it from building its strategic autonomy."</p><p>Strategic autonomy is a Brussels term that refers to the EU having an independent geopolitical policy, which relies in part on the bloc being able to become a third power and not get squashed between the US and China.</p><p>However, Macron's remarks have angered some of his allies in Washington and Eastern Europe, who see China as a threat to democracy and security in the region.</p><h2>US reaffirms commitment to Taiwan's defense</h2><p>The US has responded to Macron's comments by reaffirming its commitment to Taiwan's defense and urging its allies to do the same. The US has a longstanding policy of providing Taiwan with arms and diplomatic support, while maintaining a delicate balance of not formally recognizing its independence from China.</p><p>"We urge all countries to stand with us as we uphold our shared values and interests in support of Taiwan," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. "We will continue to work with like-minded partners to deter coercion and aggression in the Indo-Pacific."</p><p>The US also warned that China's military activities near Taiwan are destabilizing and provocative, and called on Beijing to engage in dialogue with Taipei.</p><h2>Eastern European leaders slam Macron's 'tone deaf' approach</h2><p>Macron's comments have also sparked criticism from some of his fellow European leaders, especially those in Eastern Europe who are wary of China's influence and aggression. They have accused Macron of being "tone deaf" to the realities of the world and undermining the transatlantic alliance.</p><p>Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: "Instead of building strategic autonomy from the United States, I propose a strategic partnership with the United States."</p><p>Lithuania's foreign minister tweeted: "We are capable of defending Europe without Chinese help. Instead of requesting assistance we should be projecting our strengths."</p><p>Eastern European diplomats have been less subtle. One said that Macron is "simply tone deaf to everything happening in the world. No wonder Macroning has become a synonym of bullshitting without any result." Another said they "cannot understand" Macron, that his visit to Beijing and remarks on Taiwan were "not helpful" and that Europe should engage with countries that "value democracy and the rule of law" over China.</p><h2>Macron tries to clarify his position</h2><p>Macron has since attempted to downplay his comments, saying on Wednesday that France was "for the status quo in Taiwan" and that position "has not changed." He also said that he did not want to create a rift with the US or other allies over Taiwan.</p><p>"I don't want us Europeans to be dragged into crises that are not ours," he said. "But I don't want us either to be absent or passive when it comes to defending our values and interests."</p><p>Macron also said that he had a "very good" phone call with US President Joe Biden on Tuesday, in which they discussed various issues including China, Taiwan, Ukraine and Iran.</p><h6>Macron, Taiwan, China, US, Europe</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
