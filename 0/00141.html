Each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio, and then votes for the other countries' songs to determine the winner. The contest is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the world's largest alliance of public service media.</p><p>The contest was inspired by the Sanremo Music Festival, held in Italy since 1951, and was first held in 1956 with seven countries taking part. Since then, the contest has grown to include more than 50 countries, including some outside of Europe, such as Australia, Israel and Morocco. The contest has also become a cultural phenomenon, attracting millions of viewers and fans across the world, as well as launching the careers of some of the most famous artists in music history, such as ABBA, Celine Dion, Julio Iglesias and Loreen.</p><p>The contest is known for its diversity of musical styles and genres, ranging from pop, rock and dance to folk, ethnic and opera. The contest is also famous for its colourful and sometimes eccentric costumes, staging and performances, as well as its political and social messages and controversies. Some of the most memorable moments in Eurovision history include Finland's hard rock band Lordi winning in 2006 with their monster masks and pyrotechnics, Ukraine's Ruslana performing a wild dance inspired by the Carpathian mountains in 2004, Ireland's Dana International becoming the first transgender winner in 1998 with her song "Diva", and Sweden's Loreen delivering a stunning performance of her ethereal pop anthem "Euphoria" in 2012.</p><h2>How does Eurovision work?</h2><p>The Eurovision Song Contest consists of two semi-finals and a grand final, usually held in May each year. The host country is usually the one that won the previous year's contest, unless they decline or are unable to host for some reason. In that case, another country may step in as the host. The host city is chosen by the host broadcaster in consultation with the EBU.</p><p>Each participating country selects one song and one artist or group to represent them in the contest. The selection process varies from country to country, but usually involves a national final where the public and/or a jury vote for their favourite entry among several candidates. Some countries also use internal selection, where the broadcaster chooses the entry without a public vote.</p><p>The semi-finals are held on two consecutive nights, usually on Tuesday and Thursday. Each semi-final features around 18 countries competing for 10 spots in the grand final. The countries are allocated to one of the two semi-finals by a draw that takes into account their voting patterns and geographical proximity. The voting system is based on a combination of 50% jury vote and 50% televote from each country. The jury consists of five music professionals appointed by each broadcaster, while the televote is open to anyone who can call or text a premium number or use an official app. Each country awards points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12 to their 10 favourite songs, with 12 points being the highest. The points are then added up and announced by a spokesperson from each country during a live broadcast.</p><p>The grand final is held on Saturday night and features 26 countries: the 10 qualifiers from each semi-final, plus the "Big Five" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) who are automatically qualified as the biggest financial contributors to the EBU, and the host country. The voting system is the same as in the semi-finals, except that all countries vote regardless of whether they participated or not. The winner is the country with the most points at the end of the voting. In case of a tie, the country with more votes from more countries wins. If there is still a tie, a new vote is held among the tied countries only.</p><p>The winner receives a glass microphone trophy and has the honour of hosting the next edition of the contest. The winning song also becomes part of Eurovision history and may chart across Europe and beyond.</p><h2>Who are this year's participants?</h2><p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2023 will be held in Liverpool, England, after James Newman won with his song "Embers" in Turin, Italy, in 2022. It was the first victory for the United Kingdom since 1997, and the sixth overall. "Embers" is a dance-pop song about enduring passion, which Newman said had resonance with the approaching end point of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2>Who are the favourites to win?</h2><p>The Eurovision Song Contest is notoriously unpredictable and often surprises with its results. However, some countries tend to do better than others, either because of their musical quality, popularity, diaspora or voting allies. Based on the odds from various betting sites and fan polls, some of the favourites to win Eurovision 2023 are:</p><ul><li><p>Sweden: The Scandinavian country is a powerhouse in Eurovision, having won six times and finished in the top five 24 times. Sweden is also known for its slick and modern pop production, as well as its influential national selection show Melodifestivalen. This year, Sweden will be represented by Marco Mengoni, a popular singer who has already won two Eurovisions: one as part of Italy's Il Volo in 2015, and one as a solo artist in 2019. His song "One Life" is an upbeat anthem about living in the moment and enjoying life.</p></li><li><p>France: The French have been on a roll lately in Eurovision, finishing second in 2019 and 2021 with Bilal Hassani and Barbara Pravi respectively. France is also one of the most successful countries in Eurovision history, having won five times and finished in the top five 25 times. France is also one of the few countries that sings mainly in its own language, which gives it a distinctive and authentic flavour. This year, France will be represented by La Zarra, a Parisian disco queen who will bring some retro glamour and funk to the stage with her song "Obviously".</p></li><li><p>Ukraine: The Eastern European country is one of the most consistent performers in Eurovision, having never missed a final since its debut in 2003 and having won twice in 2004 and 2016 with Ruslana and Jamala respectively. Ukraine is also known for its diverse and experimental musical styles, often incorporating elements of folk, ethnic and electronic music. This year, Ukraine will be represented by TVORCHI, a duo that combines rap, pop and rock with traditional Ukrainian instruments and melodies. Their song "Heart of Ukraine" is a tribute to their country's rich culture and history.</p></li><li><p>Spain: The Iberian country is one of the founding members of Eurovision and has participated every year since 1961. However, Spain has not had much luck in recent years, finishing last four times since 2013 and failing to reach the top ten since 2014. Spain is hoping to change that this year with Blanca Paloma, an avant-garde pop singer who will bring some edge and attitude to the contest with her song "Ya ea ea". The song is a catchy and quirky tune that mixes Spanish and English lyrics with electronic beats and vocal effects.</p></li><li><p>Italy: The Mediterranean country is another founding member of Eurovision and has won three times: in 1964 with Gigliola Cinquetti , in 1990 with Toto Cutugno , and in 2021 with Måneskin . Italy is also one of the most respected and influential countries in Eurovision, having produced some of the most iconic songs and artists in the contest's history. Italy is also one of the few countries that sings mainly in its own language, which gives it a distinctive and authentic flavour. This year, Italy will be represented by Måneskin again, who will try to defend their title with their new song "Space Man". The song is a rock anthem about breaking free from conformity and exploring new horizons.</p></li></ul><h2>How can you watch Eurovision?</h2><p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2023 will be broadcast live on television and radio across Europe and beyond by the participating broadcasters.
