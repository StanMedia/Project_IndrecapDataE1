They have unearthed a 1,000-year-old mummy of a teenager with skin and hair preserved, dating back to pre-Inca times.</p><p>The mummy was found in an underground tomb wrapped in a funerary bundle, along with ceramics and rope and including bits of skin and hair. The mummified teenager was in a "good state of conservation," according to archaeologist Yomira Huaman, who is in charge of the Cajamarquilla research project affiliated with the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.</p><p>The teenager might have belonged to one of the pre-Inca cultures that flourished in the central coast and the Andes of Peru, such as the Lima or Ichma cultures. These cultures developed complex societies with advanced agriculture, trade, art, and religion. They also built impressive monuments and cities out of mud-bricks and stones. The mummy lived between 1,100 and 1,200 years ago, Huaman said.</p><p>The mummy was discovered about 200 meters (220 yards) from where another mummy was found last year, Huaman added. The archaeological site is also where the remains of eight children and 12 adults, who were apparently sacrificed around 800-1,200 years ago, were found.</p><p>The sprawling Cajamarquilla complex features the ruins of four pyramids and other constructions such as walls laid out like a maze. The complex is the second largest mud-brick city in Peru after Chan Chan in the north of the country. Cajamarquilla was possibly occupied by people from both the coast and the Andean highlands, Huaman said. The site was believed to be a thriving trading center.</p><p>Peru is well known for its rich pre-Hispanic heritage, especially for the mountain-top Inca royal retreat of Machu Picchu. However, there are many other ancient cultures that preceded the Inca and left behind impressive monuments and artifacts that reveal their history and way of life.</p><p>Mummies are among the most fascinating and valuable sources of information for archaeologists and historians. They can provide insights into the health, diet, lifestyle, beliefs, and rituals of ancient people. Mummies can also help scientists to reconstruct their facial features and genetic ancestry.</p><p>The discovery of the pre-Inca mummy in Peru is a significant contribution to the study of ancient cultures and their practices of preserving their dead. The mummy will be further analyzed to determine its age, sex, cause of death, and possible diseases or injuries. The funerary bundle will also be examined to identify its contents and meaning.</p><p>The Peruvian archaeologists hope to continue their research at Cajamarquilla and uncover more secrets of this ancient city and its inhabitants.</p><h2>About pre-Inca</h2><p>Before the rise of the Inca Empire, there were many pre-Inca civilizations that developed in different regions of Peru and neighboring countries. These civilizations had diverse cultures, languages, and achievements, and some of them influenced or interacted with the Incas. Some of the most notable pre-Inca civilizations were:</p><ul><li>The Caral or Norte Chico civilization, which was the oldest known civilization in the Americas, dating back to around 3000 BC. They built pyramids and temples in the Supe Valley, north of Lima.</li><li>The Chavin civilization, which flourished from around 900 BC to 200 BC in the northern Andean highlands. They built large temples with elaborate sculptures and carvings, such as the Lanzon Monolith and the Raimondi Stela.</li><li>The Paracas civilization, which developed from around 800 BC to 100 BC in the Ica region. They were known for their advanced textile art and their burial practices, which involved wrapping their dead in colorful fabrics and placing them in underground chambers.</li><li>The Nasca civilization, which emerged from around 100 BC to 800 AD in the southern coast. They were famous for their geoglyphs or Nasca Lines, which are large drawings of animals and geometric shapes on the desert floor, visible only from the air.</li><li>The Moche civilization, which existed from around 100 AD to 800 AD in the northern coast. They were a complex urban society that built pyramids, canals, and irrigation systems. They also produced fine pottery and metalwork, and practiced human sacrifice.</li><li>The Wari civilization, which expanded from around 600 AD to 1100 AD in the central highlands and coast. They were a powerful empire that built stone cities, roads, and terraces. They also influenced the Tiwanaku civilization, which developed in the Altiplano region near Lake Titicaca.</li><li>The Lambayeque or Sicán civilization, which rose from around 750 AD to 1375 AD in the northern coast. They were skilled goldsmiths and traders, who left behind numerous gold, silver, and copper objects. They also built large adobe pyramids and tombs.</li><li>The Lima or Ichma civilization, which dominated from around 900 AD to 1470 AD in the central coast. They built mud-brick pyramids and palaces, and worshiped a deity called Pachacamac. They were later conquered by the Inca Empire.</li></ul><p>These pre-Inca civilizations left behind impressive monuments and artifacts that reveal their history and way of life. They also provide valuable insights into the cultural diversity and complexity of ancient Peru.</p><h6>Peru, mummy, archaeology, pre-Inca</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
