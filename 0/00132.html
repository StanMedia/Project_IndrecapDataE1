They are made of thin plastic sheets, tape and charcoal dust, and can be built with materials from hardware and pyrotechnic supply stores. They can carry sensors up to 70,000 feet (21 kilometers) above the ground, twice as high as commercial jets can fly.</p><h2>Why are they used to record sounds?</h2><p>The stratosphere is the second layer of Earth's atmosphere, where the ozone layer protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. It is also a relatively quiet and calm place, with little turbulence or wind. This makes it ideal for recording low-frequency sounds that are inaudible to the human ear, known as infrasound.</p><p>Infrasound can be generated by natural phenomena such as volcanoes, earthquakes, thunderstorms and ocean waves, as well as human-made sources such as explosions, aircraft and rockets. Infrasound can travel long distances and reveal information about the source and the medium it passes through.</p><p>However, infrasound is difficult to detect on the ground, because it is masked by noise and attenuated by air. Therefore, scientists have been using balloons to record infrasound in the stratosphere since the 1960s, but the technology was expensive and limited.</p><h2>What are the new findings?</h2><p>Daniel Bowman, principal scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, and his collaborators have developed a low-cost and high-altitude platform for infrasound recording using solar balloons. They have conducted research using NASA balloons and other flight providers, but they also decided to build their own balloons with a team of two people in about 3.5 hours.</p><p>They have attached microphones and GPS trackers to their solar balloons and launched them from various locations around the world. They have recorded infrasound signals from surface and buried chemical explosions, thunder, ocean waves colliding, propeller aircraft, city sounds, suborbital rocket launches and earthquakes.</p><p>They have also recorded sounds whose origin is unclear. These include mysterious infrasound signals that occur a few times per hour on some flights, as well as crackles and rustling noises that may be caused by electrical discharges or balloon vibrations.</p><p>The findings were shared at the 184th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Chicago on May 11th, 2023. Bowman also shared a recording from a NASA balloon that circled Antarctica, which contains infrasound of colliding ocean waves that sound like continual sighing.</p><h2>What are the implications?</h2><p>The solar balloon platform offers a new way to explore the soundscape of the stratosphere and to monitor natural and human-made events that generate infrasound. It can also provide insights into the dynamics of the stratosphere itself, such as temperature variations and gravity waves.</p><p>Bowman said that he hopes to continue his research and to collaborate with other scientists who are interested in using solar balloons for infrasound recording. He also said that he wants to inspire students and hobbyists to build their own solar balloons and to discover the wonders of the stratosphere.</p><h6>Solar balloon, Stratosphere, Infrasound</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
