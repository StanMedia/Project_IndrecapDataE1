The regime has also accused Washington and Seoul of conducting "hostile" military exercises and imposing "unjust" sanctions.</p><p>Biden and Yoon said they were committed to pursuing a "diplomatic and comprehensive" approach to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, but also warned that they would respond "decisively" to any provocation.</p><p>"We will continue to closely coordinate our approaches toward North Korea. We will continue to explore diplomacy with DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) but we will not do so at the expense of our security," Biden said.</p><h2>US nuclear submarine is a 'symbolic' move</h2><p>The US Navy has 14 Ohio-class, nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), with eight based in Washington state and six based in Georgia. The 560-foot submarines, commonly called "boomers," have a displacement of more than 18,000 tons when submerged and are each powered by a single nuclear reactor.</p><p>Each of the Ohio-class subs carry a maximum of 20 Trident II ballistic missiles. These have a range of 4,600 miles (7,400 kilometers), meaning they are capable of hitting a target in North Korea from vast swathes of the Pacific, Indian or Arctic oceans.</p><p>"Militarily, (these submarines) don't need to be anywhere near Korea in order to reach potential targets there," said Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.</p><p>Each Trident missile is capable of carrying multiple warheads that can be directed toward separate targets. The Nuclear Threat Initiative at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that each Trident missile can carry four nuclear warheads, meaning each US ballistic missile submarine could be carrying about 80 nuclear warheads.</p><p>In other words, a single Trident-armed sub could destroy all of North Korea.</p><p>So why send one to South Korea?</p><p>Analysts say the presence of a US Navy ballistic missile submarine in a South Korean port would be purely symbolic -- and in fact would reduce the military value of the sub.</p><p>"It's not really adding anything new or different in terms of capabilities. It's more about sending a message," said Ankit Panda, Stanton senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>Panda said the message was not only directed at North Korea, but also at China and Russia, which have been accused by the US of undermining sanctions on Pyongyang and enabling its nuclear program.</p><p>"It's a way of signaling that the US is serious about its alliance commitments and its extended deterrence commitments in Northeast Asia," he said.</p><p>However, Panda also pointed out that sending the sub on a -- very public -- foreign port visit only compromises the effectiveness of a weapon designed for stealth.</p><p>"The whole point of these submarines is that they're supposed to be undetectable. They're supposed to be out there somewhere in the ocean where nobody knows where they are," he said.</p><p>"By bringing them into port, you're basically giving away their location. You're also exposing them to potential espionage or sabotage."</p><p>Panda said that while such risks were low given the security measures involved, they were still unnecessary.</p><p>He also questioned whether such a move would have any impact on North Korea's behavior or calculations.</p><p>"I don't think it's going to change anything in terms of North Korea's willingness to come back to the negotiating table or to give up its nuclear weapons," he said.</p><p>"It might even have the opposite effect of reinforcing North Korea's sense of insecurity and paranoia."</p><h2>US and South Korea seek to revive diplomacy with North Korea</h2><p>Despite the show of force, both Biden and Yoon said they were open to engaging with North Korea and seeking a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue.</p><p>Biden said he would appoint a special envoy for North Korea, who would coordinate with South Korea and other allies on diplomatic efforts.</p><p>He also said he would not repeat the mistakes of previous administrations, which he said had given North Korea concessions without getting anything in return.</p><p>"We're going to continue to consult with our allies and partners. And there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly. But I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization," Biden said.</p><p>Yoon said he welcomed Biden's "principled and practical" approach to North Korea, and expressed hope that the two leaders could meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the future.</p><p>He also said he was willing to cooperate with China, North Korea's main ally and benefactor, on the issue.</p><p>"China is a very important partner in our efforts for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. And we hope that China will play a more active role in this regard," Yoon said.</p><p>However, China has been critical of the US-South Korea alliance, accusing them of provoking North Korea and undermining regional stability.</p><p>On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin urged the US and South Korea to "stop all forms of military exercises and actions that are not conducive to easing tensions."</p><p>He also called on them to "respect China's legitimate security concerns and stop undermining China's interests."</p><h2>USS Alaska: A nuclear-armed submarine with a long history</h2><p>USS Alaska (SSBN-732), is a United States Navy Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine which has been in commission since 1986. She is the fourth US Navy ship to be named for the Territory or State of Alaska.</p><p>The submarine was built by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, and launched on 12 January 1985, sponsored by Mrs. Catherine Stevens, wife of US Senator Theodore F. Stevens of Alaska. She was commissioned on 25 January 1986, with Captain Paul L. Callahan in command of the Blue Crew and Captain Charles J. Chotvacs in command of the Gold Crew.</p><p>The submarine has two crews that alternate patrols, each consisting of 15 officers and 140 enlisted personnel. The submarine is designed to spend on average 77 days at sea, followed by 35 days in port for maintenance.</p><p>The submarine is armed with 20 Trident II D5 ballistic missiles, each capable of carrying four nuclear warheads that can be directed toward separate targets. The missiles have a range of 4,600 miles (7,400 kilometers), meaning they can strike targets in North Korea from anywhere in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>The submarine also carries Mk-48 torpedoes for self-defense and can launch Tomahawk cruise missiles for conventional strikes.</p><p>The submarine is powered by a single nuclear reactor that propels it to speeds greater than 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph) and depths greater than 800 feet (240 m).</p><p>The submarine has participated in several deterrent patrols and exercises in the Pacific Ocean, as well as visiting ports in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, and South Korea.</p><p>In 2000-2001, the submarine underwent an overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, where it received upgrades to fire the Trident II D5 missile and the Mk-48 ADCAP torpedo.</p><p>In 2006, the submarine completed its 59th deterrent patrol and shifted its homeport from Bangor, Washington, to Kings Bay, Georgia.</p><p>In 2018, the submarine was selected to receive the Omaha Trophy for being the best ballistic missile submarine in the US Navy.</p><p>In 2023, the submarine was announced to visit South Korea for the first time since 1981, as part of a landmark deal between the US and South Korea to deter North Korean aggression.</p><h6>US, South Korea, North Korea, nuclear submarine, diplomacy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
