They are caused by different viruses and can have varying degrees of severity. Some people may have no symptoms (asymptomatic), while others may have mild to severe symptoms.</p><p>Flu is caused by influenza viruses that infect the respiratory tract. There are different types and strains of influenza viruses that circulate every year. Flu can cause complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, ear infections, and worsening of chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease. Flu can also be fatal in some cases, especially for older adults, young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.</p><p>Cold is caused by many different viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract. The most common cause of cold is rhinovirus, but other viruses such as coronavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus can also cause cold. Cold is usually a mild illness that lasts for a few days to a week. Cold can sometimes lead to secondary bacterial infections such as sinusitis or otitis media.</p><p>COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in 2019. COVID-19 can cause a wide range of symptoms that may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. COVID-19 can cause complications such as pneumonia, blood clots, organ damage, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and long-term effects such as fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, and loss of smell or taste. COVID-19 can also be fatal in some cases, especially for older adults and people with underlying medical conditions.</p><h2>Flu, cold and COVID-19 symptoms can overlap but have some key differences</h2><p>Flu, cold and COVID-19 share some common symptoms such as fever or feeling feverish/having chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, headache, muscle pain or body aches, fatigue (tiredness), vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children). However, there are some key differences that can help distinguish them:</p><ul><li>Change in or loss of taste or smell: This is more common and often the first symptom of COVID-19 than flu or cold.</li><li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing: This is more common and severe with COVID-19 than flu or cold.</li><li>Chest pain or pressure: This is more common and serious with COVID-19 than flu or cold.</li><li>Nausea or abdominal pain: This is more common with COVID-19 than flu or cold.</li><li>Rash or skin changes: This is more common with COVID-19 than flu or cold.</li><li>Conjunctivitis (pink eye): This is more common with COVID-19 than flu or cold.</li></ul><p>The only way to confirm the diagnosis of flu, cold or COVID-19 is by taking a specific test that detects the virus causing the illness. Testing is especially important for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 or who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. Testing can help prevent the spread of the virus and provide appropriate treatment and care.</p><h2>How to prevent and treat flu, cold and COVID-19</h2><p>Flu, cold and COVID-19 can be prevented by taking some common measures such as:</p><ul><li>Getting vaccinated against flu and COVID-19 when eligible and recommended</li><li>Washing hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li><li>Covering mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing</li><li>Avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Wearing a mask or face covering when in public or around people who are sick</li><li>Avoiding close contact with people who are sick</li><li>Staying home when sick</li><li>Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces</li></ul><p>Flu, cold and COVID-19 can be treated by taking some common steps such as:</p><ul><li>Drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated</li><li>Resting as much as possible</li><li>Taking over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and pain</li><li>Using saline nasal spray or drops to relieve nasal congestion</li><li>Using a humidifier or steam inhalation to ease cough and sore throat</li><li>Gargling with warm salt water to soothe sore throat</li><li>Sucking on lozenges or hard candy to relieve dry cough</li><li>Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and protein to boost immunity</li></ul><p>Flu, cold and COVID-19 may require medical attention in some cases, such as:</p><ul><li>Having trouble breathing or chest pain</li><li>Having a high fever that lasts more than three days</li><li>Having severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea</li><li>Having signs of dehydration such as dry mouth, sunken eyes, or reduced urine output</li><li>Having confusion, drowsiness, or difficulty waking up</li><li>Having a rash or skin changes that do not go away</li><li>Having symptoms that get worse or do not improve after a week</li></ul><p>If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor or seek emergency care immediately.</p><h6>Flu, cold, COVID-19, symptoms, prevention</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
