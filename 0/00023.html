According to witnesses, a waiter was preparing a flambéed pizza, a dish where alcohol is poured over the food and briefly set alight, when the flames reached the plastic flowers decorating the ceiling and columns of the establishment.</p><p>The fire spread quickly, creating a thick cloud of smoke that filled the restaurant, which had about 30 diners and staff members at the time. The only exit was blocked by the fire, forcing people to retreat to the back of the restaurant, where they were trapped.</p><p>Firefighters arrived at the scene within minutes, as their station was only a few hundred meters away from the restaurant. They managed to extinguish the fire in less than 10 minutes and rescue 12 people who were injured by smoke inhalation or burns. However, two people could not be saved: a restaurant employee and a customer, who died at the scene.</p><h2>The investigation</h2><p>The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, visited the site of the tragedy on Saturday morning and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. He said that the fire appeared to have been caused by "a human error" and that it was "a very unfortunate accident".</p><p>He also said that the city authorities would investigate whether the restaurant had complied with all the safety regulations and whether it had a valid license to serve flambéed dishes. He added that he would review the existing norms to prevent similar incidents from happening again.</p><p>The police have also opened an investigation into the incident and are questioning the witnesses and survivors. They are also examining the security cameras and other evidence from the restaurant.</p><h2>The reaction</h2><p>The incident has shocked and saddened many people in Madrid and across Spain, who have expressed their solidarity with the victims and their families on social media. Some have also criticized the restaurant for using flammable decorations and for not having adequate fire prevention measures.</p><p>The Italian embassy in Spain also issued a statement expressing its "deep sorrow" for the loss of lives and offering its support to those affected by the fire. It said that it was following closely the developments of the investigation and that it was ready to assist any Italian citizens who might have been involved in the incident.</p><p>The flambéed pizza is a popular dish in some Italian restaurants, especially in Naples, where it is known as pizza all'acqua pazza (pizza with crazy water). It is usually made with mozzarella cheese, cherry tomatoes, basil, olive oil, and white wine or brandy. The alcohol is poured over the pizza after it is cooked and then ignited with a blowtorch or a match, creating a spectacular effect.</p><p>However, experts warn that flambéing food can be dangerous if not done properly and with caution. They advise using only small amounts of alcohol, keeping a safe distance from the flames, and avoiding any flammable materials nearby.</p><h6>Madrid, fire, pizza, flambé</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
