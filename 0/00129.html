Many hoped to return soon, but as the conflict dragged on, their animals were left to fend for themselves in a war-torn country.</p><p>That's when Valentina and Leonid Stoyanov, a couple of veterinarians who specialized in exotic animal and wildlife rescue, stepped in. They began working with local police to access homes and rescue dogs and cats that were locked inside or roaming the streets. Within a week of the invasion, they were caring for some 400 animals in their Odesa clinic.</p><p>"Each animal for us, it's like members of our family," Valentina told CNN.</p><p>The Stoyanovs have been rescuing animals for over a decade, treating monkeys, snakes, owls, and other creatures that they often featured on their "Vet Crew" TikTok and Instagram feeds. But the war changed their lives drastically.</p><p>"All our family – mother, father – have to leave Ukraine," Leonid said. "But we decided we stay here and help animals – a lot of animals."</p><p>Their clinic is partially underground and surrounded by taller buildings that offer some protection from Russian attacks. But they face many challenges, such as the lack of electricity, which affects their equipment and their reptiles' heating. They had to buy a generator to keep the lights on and the animals warm.</p><p>They also bought tons of dog and cat food that they distribute to area shelters. And they have often driven to the front lines to help animals in need, risking their lives in the process.</p><p>"Russian army a lot of times shooting our car and they bombed it. And one time they missed (by) maybe ten meters. And we have a lot of holes in our car," Leonid said.</p><p>Valentina and Leonid Stoyanov have been rescuing animals in Ukraine since the war started</p><h2>The health toll of caring for animals in a war zone</h2><p>The stress and danger of their work have also taken a toll on their health. Leonid suffered a heart attack and said he was clinically dead for several minutes before doctors were able to revive him.</p><p>"They say, 'You have a lot of animals. You need to (be) here,'" he said.</p><p>He has since had two surgeries, including one to implant a pacemaker. And despite some discomfort, he says he feels "physically normal" now.</p><p>The Stoyanovs usually try to find new homes for the animals they rescue, or they release wild animals back into their natural habitat. But some pets have become permanent members of their family, such as Casper, a blind husky that they adopted.</p><p>They also hope to reunite some of the pets with their original owners someday, if they ever return to Ukraine. They keep records of the animals' names and addresses, and post photos and videos of them online.</p><p>"We hope that maybe after war finish ... we can find owners," Valentina said.</p><p>But until then, they will continue to care for the animals as best as they can, even if it means putting their own lives at risk.</p><p>"We love our country. We love our animals," Leonid said. "And we will do everything for them."</p><h2>How animal lovers and activists are trying to save the furry victims of the conflict</h2><p>The war in Ukraine has claimed thousands of human lives and displaced millions of people. But it has also left behind countless animals that have been injured, abandoned, or forgotten in the chaos.</p><p>Some of these animals are pets that belonged to refugees who had to flee their homes, hoping to return soon. Others are strays that roamed the streets or farm animals that were left behind by their owners. Many of them have suffered from hunger, cold, disease, or violence.</p><p>But there are also people who care for these animals and try to save them from their plight. They are veterinarians, shelter workers, volunteers, activists, and ordinary citizens who risk their lives to rescue, treat, feed, and adopt the wounded and homeless pets of Ukraine.</p><h2>The vets who stayed behind to care for abandoned pets</h2><p>One example of these animal heroes is Valentina and Leonid Stoyanov, a couple of veterinarians who specialized in exotic animal and wildlife rescue. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2023, they decided to stay in their Odesa clinic and care for the dogs and cats that were left behind by fleeing refugees.</p><p>They began working with local police to access homes and rescue animals that were locked inside or roaming the streets.

We love our animals," Leonid said. "And we will do everything for them."</p><h2>The shelters that provide refuge for wounded and homeless animals</h2><p>Another example of animal lovers who are trying to save the furry victims of the war are the shelter workers and volunteers who provide refuge for wounded and homeless animals.</p><p>One of these shelters is Green Grove in Irpin, near Kyiv, which was founded by Olena Babakova in 2014 after she witnessed the suffering of animals during the Maidan protests.</p><p>She started by taking in dogs that were injured by rubber bullets or tear gas during the clashes between protesters and police. Then she expanded her shelter to accommodate more animals that were affected by the war in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>She now has more than 300 dogs and 100 cats under her care, many of them with injuries or disabilities.</p><p>Babakova, who is also a journalist and activist, said she started the shelter after witnessing the suffering of animals during the Maidan protests in 2014, when dogs were injured by rubber bullets or tear gas during the clashes between protesters and police.</p><p>She said she felt a moral obligation to help the animals that were affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, especially since many of them were pets that had been loved and cared for by their owners.</p><p>"I think it's very important to show that we are not only fighting for our freedom and democracy, but also for our humanity and compassion," she told the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>Babakova said she relies on donations and volunteers to run the shelter, which costs about $10,000 a month. She also tries to find new homes for the animals, either in Ukraine or abroad.</p><p>She said she hopes that her shelter can be a model for other animal sanctuaries in Ukraine and beyond.</p><p>"I think it's a very good example of how people can cooperate and help each other in difficult times," she said.</p><h2>The activists who cross the border to rescue animals</h2><p>A third example of animal lovers who are trying to save the furry victims of the war are the activists who cross the border to rescue animals from the conflict zone.</p><p>One of these groups is PETA Germany, which has been working with partner organizations in neighboring Romania to get into Ukraine and rescue abandoned animals, as well as offering to vaccinate and sterilize dogs and cats.</p><p>Jennifer White, a spokesperson for PETA Germany, said the group has been on the border trying to "shepherd animals out safely", as there are rules around microchipping and vaccination for animals crossing the border.</p><p>She said the group has donated two tonnes of cat and dog food, as well as blankets and coats for people and animals who have been walking long distances.</p><p>She said the group has also been documenting the plight of animals in Ukraine, such as dogs that have been shot or maimed by landmines or shrapnel.</p><p>"We want to raise awareness about what's happening to these animals, because they are often forgotten in war situations," she told CNN.</p><p>White said the group hopes that their efforts can inspire more people to help animals in need, and to adopt them if possible.</p><p>"We believe that every animal deserves a chance at life, and a loving home," she said. "We hope that people will see these animals as individuals, not as objects."</p><h6>Ukraine, war, pets, veterinarians</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
