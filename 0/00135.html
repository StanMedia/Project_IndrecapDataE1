The press advocacy group said it had documented at least 20 journalists killed by Israeli military fire since 2001, adding that Palestinians make up 80 percent of journalists and media workers killed by the Israeli military.</p><p>"No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths," it said in the press release. "The Israeli military's impunity in the killing of at least 20 journalists in the past 20 years severely undermines the freedom of the press."</p><p>The report also highlights that "Israeli officials discount evidence and witness claims, often appearing to clear soldiers for the killings while inquiries are still in progress," adding that the Israeli military's inquiries of the killings are a "black box", with results kept secret.</p><p>"When probes do take place, the Israeli military often takes months or years to investigate killings and families of the mostly Palestinian journalists have little recourse inside Israel to pursue justice," the CPJ said.</p><h2>The case of Shireen Abu Akleh illustrates the Israeli military's impunity</h2><p>The CPJ report comes just two days before the one-year-anniversary of the death of Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, a 51-year-old Palestinian-American who was killed by a bullet to the head on May 11, 2022 while covering an Israeli military operation in Jenin.</p><p>Abu Akleh was wearing a helmet and a blue protective vest marked "Press" when she was fatally shot. A CNN investigation in May last year unearthed evidence – including two videos of the scene of the shooting – that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death. Footage obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggested that Israeli forces took aim at the journalist.</p><p>While the IDF admitted for the first time in September that there was a "high possibility" Abu Akleh was "accidentally" shot and killed by Israeli fire, its Military Advocate General's Office said in a statement that it did not intend to pursue criminal charges or prosecutions of any of the soldiers involved.</p><p>The CPJ report says Abu Akleh's case illustrates "the routine sequence" that takes place when a journalist is killed at the hands of the IDF. The report says human rights groups have consistently raised concerns about "the ... slow pace of these totally confidential assessments, which can drag on for months or years", during which "witnesses' memories fade, evidence may disappear or be destroyed, and soldiers involved can coordinate testimonies".</p><p>Hagai El-Ad, executive director of Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, said in the report that Israel's examination of its soldiers' actions was a less serious inquiry than a "theater of investigation".</p><p>"They want to make it look credible. They go through the motions, things take a lot of time, a lot of paperwork," he told CPJ. "But the bottom line ... is almost blanket impunity for security forces."</p><h2>The impact of Israeli military killings on press freedom and human rights</h2><p>The CPJ report says that the Israeli military's killings of journalists and lack of accountability have a chilling effect on press freedom and human rights in Israel and Palestine.</p><p>"The killing or injuring of journalists not only silences individual reporters but also deprives their audiences – both domestic and international – from receiving vital information about areas affected by conflict," it says.</p><p>The report also notes that Palestinian journalists face additional challenges and risks due to their status under occupation and their exposure to violence from both Israeli forces and Palestinian factions.</p><p>"Palestinian journalists are doubly vulnerable: They are targeted by both sides," Nasser Abu Bakr, head of the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate (PJS), told CPJ. "We are under occupation and we are also under pressure from our own authorities."</p><h2>The report calls for international pressure and action to ensure justice</h2><p>The CPJ report urges the international community, including the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and other countries, to pressure Israel to end its impunity for killing journalists and to respect press freedom and human rights.</p><p>The report also calls for the establishment of an independent international mechanism to investigate and prosecute cases of journalists killed by Israeli military fire, as well as compensation for the families of the victims.</p><p>The report says that such measures are necessary to prevent further killings of journalists and to ensure that those responsible are held accountable.</p><p>"Without accountability, there is no deterrence," Sherif Mansour, CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, told CPJ. "And without deterrence, journalists will continue to be killed."</p><h6>Israel, Palestine, press freedom, journalists, killings, impunity</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
