It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD — attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder — especially during the pandemic.</p><p>The term "body doubling" comes from the film industry, where a body double is someone who substitutes for an actor in certain scenes. In the context of ADHD, a body double is someone who provides a supportive presence while the person with ADHD works on a task that they find difficult or boring.</p><p>The body double does not have to be physically present or actively involved in the task. They can be a friend, family member, colleague, coach or even a stranger who agrees to work alongside the person with ADHD, either in person or virtually.</p><p>"The idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task," said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. "For folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task."</p><h2>Why does it work?</h2><p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects executive function and self-regulation skills, such as planning, focusing, remembering and multitasking. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, which can affect both work and personal lives.</p><p>People with ADHD often struggle with tasks that require sustained attention, organization or time management, especially if they have no intrinsic interest in them. They may also experience procrastination, avoidance or anxiety around these tasks.</p><p>Body doubling works by providing a sense of accountability, structure and support for people with ADHD. It also taps into their social nature and desire to please others.</p><p>"It also draws on our social selves," said J. Russell Ramsay, professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and codirector of the university’s ADHD Treatment and Research Program. "A lot of people with ADHD will say, ‘I have a hard time getting started on this if I’m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I’m more likely to go and be there because I don’t want to let them down.’"</p><h2>How to do it?</h2><p>There are different ways to practice body doubling, depending on the preferences and needs of the person with ADHD and their body double. Some possible steps are:</p><ul><li>Identify a task that you want to work on and set a specific goal and time frame for it.</li><li>Find a suitable body double who is willing to work with you. It can be someone you know or someone you find online through platforms such as Focusmate or ADDA Virtual Peer Support.</li><li>Decide how you want to communicate with your body double. You can use video calls, phone calls, text messages or any other method that works for you.</li><li>Agree on the level of interaction you want with your body double. You can choose to chat before and after the session, check in periodically during the session or work silently throughout the session.</li><li>Start working on your task while your body double works on theirs. You can use timers, alarms or apps to help you stay on track and take breaks as needed.</li><li>Celebrate your progress and thank your body double for their help.</li></ul><h2>What are the benefits?</h2><p>Body doubling can offer various benefits for people with ADHD, such as:</p><ul><li>Increased focus and productivity</li><li>Reduced procrastination and avoidance</li><li>Enhanced self-esteem and confidence</li><li>Lowered stress and anxiety</li><li>Improved mood and motivation</li><li>Strengthened social connections and support</li></ul><p>Body doubling can also benefit the body double themselves by:</p><ul><li>Learning more about the challenges of ADHD</li><li>Modeling effective ways to complete tasks</li><li>Boosting their own focus and productivity</li><li>Enjoying the company and gratitude of the person with ADHD</li></ul><h2>What are the limitations?</h2><p>Body doubling is not a cure-all for ADHD. It is not a substitute for professional treatment or medication. It may not work for everyone or for every task. It may also have some drawbacks, such as:</p><ul><li>Dependence on another person</li><li>Difficulty finding a compatible body double</li><li>Distraction or discomfort from social interaction</li><li>Privacy or confidentiality issues</li><li>Technical glitches or interruptions</li></ul><p>Body doubling is best used as a complementary strategy that can enhance the effectiveness of other interventions for ADHD, such as therapy, coaching, medication, education and self-care.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Body doubling is a simple and powerful strategy that can help people with ADHD stay focused and productive on tasks that they find challenging or uninteresting. It involves working with another person around who provides a supportive presence and a gentle reminder to stay on task. It can also improve mood, motivation and self-esteem for people with ADHD, as well as their body doubles. Body doubling can be done in person or virtually, with different levels of interaction and communication. It is not a cure for ADHD, but a helpful tool that can complement other treatments and coping skills.</p><h6>Body doubling, ADHD, productivity, focus, motivation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
