Col. Joe Buccino said that the Russian pilots do not appear to be trying to shoot down American jets, but they may be trying to "provoke" the US and "draw us into an international incident."</p><p>Dogfighting is a term used to describe engaging in aerial combat, often at relatively close ranges. A video released by US Central Command from April 2 shows a Russian SU-35 fighter jet conducting an "unsafe and unprofessional" intercept of a US F-16 fighter jet. A second video from April 18th shows a Russian fighter that violated coalition airspace and came within 2,000 feet of a US aircraft, a distance a fighter jet can cover in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Over the last several years, the US and Russia have used a deconfliction line between the two militaries in Syria to avoid unintentional mistakes or encounters that can inadvertently lead to escalation. US officials have reached out to their Russian counterparts over the recent incidents, and the Russians have responded, but "never in a way that acknowledges the incident," a US official told CNN.</p><p>Since the beginning of March, Russian jets have violated deconfliction protocols a total of 85 times, including flying too close to coalition bases, failing to reach out on the deconfliction line, and more. That also includes 26 instances in which armed Russian jets flew over US and coalition positions in Syria.</p><p>"It looks to be consistent with a new way of operating," the official said.</p><p>US pilots have refused to engage in the dogfights and are adhering to the protocols of the deconfliction measures, the official added.</p><p>The US has approximately 900 service members in Syria as part of the ongoing campaign to defeat ISIS. The more aggressive behavior from Russian pilots has occurred outside of Syria as well. In March, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet collided with a US MQ-9 Reaper drone in international airspace over the Black Sea. The collision damaged the drone's propellor, forcing it down in the water in an incident the US described as "unsafe, unprofessional" and even "reckless."</p><p>"It's concerning because it increases the risk of miscalculation, and given incidents like the MQ-9 intercept and subsequent downing over the Black Sea, it's not the kind of behavior I'd expect out of a professional Air Force," the commander of US Air Force Central Command, Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich said in a statement earlier this month.</p><h2>A complex and crowded airspace</h2><p>The incidents highlight the complexity and crowdedness of the Syrian airspace, where multiple actors are operating with different agendas and objectives. While both the US and Russia are fighting against ISIS militants, they support opposing sides in the Syrian civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced more than half of the country's pre-war population.</p><p>Russia backs the Assad regime, which has been accused of using chemical weapons and committing atrocities against its own people. The US supports a patchwork of rebel forces that are fighting against government troops and their allies. The US also continues to launch airstrikes and raids from elsewhere in the region in its decade-long mission to contain ISIS inside Syria.</p><p>The two powers have occasionally clashed over their interests and actions in Syria. In 2017, President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian airbase after a chemical attack on civilians blamed on Assad's forces. In 2018, another missile strike targeted Syrian chemical weapons facilities after another suspected attack on civilians.</p><p>In 2018, hundreds of Russian mercenaries reportedly attacked a base where US troops were stationed near Deir Ezzor, resulting in dozens of casualties among the attackers. The US said it acted in self-defense and warned Russia beforehand.</p><p>In 2019, Turkey launched an offensive against Kurdish forces that had been allied with the US in fighting ISIS, prompting Trump to withdraw most American troops from northern Syria. The move was widely criticized as a betrayal of the Kurds and a boon for Russia, Iran and Turkey, which have expanded their influence in Syria.</p><p>The US still maintains a small presence in al-Tanf, a strategic base near the border with Iraq and Jordan, where it trains and advises local fighters against ISIS and Iran-backed militias. The base is also seen as a deterrent against Iranian attempts to establish a land corridor from Tehran to Beirut through Iraq and Syria.</p><h2>A tense relationship between US and Russia</h2><p>The aerial incidents over Syria reflect the tense and competitive relationship between the US and Russia, which have clashed over various issues such as Ukraine, cyberattacks, human rights, arms control and sanctions.</p><p>The two countries have also engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions and closures of consulates and missions. In April, Biden expelled 10 Russian diplomats and imposed new sanctions on Russia over its alleged interference in the 2020 US presidential election and its involvement in the SolarWinds cyberattack that compromised several US government agencies and private companies.</p><p>Russia responded by expelling 10 US diplomats and banning eight current and former US officials from entering its territory. It also suggested that the US ambassador leave Moscow for consultations.</p><p>Biden has said that he wants a "stable and predictable" relationship with Russia, but also that he will not hesitate to respond to its "harmful activities". He has proposed a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a range of issues of mutual concern.</p><p>The two leaders are expected to meet in June in Geneva, Switzerland, where they will try to find some common ground on issues such as strategic stability, arms control, climate change and regional conflicts.</p><p>However, experts warn that the summit is unlikely to produce any major breakthroughs or agreements, given the deep mistrust and divergent interests between the two sides.</p><p>"The summit is not going to be a reset or a reboot or anything like that," said Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. "It's going to be an attempt to manage a very difficult relationship."</p><h6>US, Russia, Syria, dogfight, ISIS</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
