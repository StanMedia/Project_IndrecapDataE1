He has called for the creation of a "G20 for peace" - a group of countries that are strong enough to be respected at the negotiating table, but that are still considered by some as neutral in the conflict.</p><p>Lula's proposal is to include countries such as Indonesia, India, and China, which have close ties with both Russia and Ukraine, as well as Latin American countries that are not directly affected by the war. He has also reached out to leaders from the United Arab Emirates and Germany to discuss his initiative.</p><p>Lula's vision is based on his belief that both Russia and Ukraine are responsible for the conflict. He has condemned Russia's decision to invade its neighbor, but also claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could have done more to avoid the escalation. He has insisted that Brazil would not take sides in the dispute, but rather seek a peaceful solution that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p><h2>Lula's challenges and opportunities</h2><p>Lula's peace initiative faces several challenges and opportunities. On one hand, he has to deal with the skepticism and resistance from some of the main actors involved in the conflict, such as the United States, the European Union, and NATO, which have been providing Ukraine with weapons and other support since Russia's invasion. They may see Lula's mediation as an interference or a distraction from their own efforts to pressure Russia to withdraw its troops and respect international law.</p><p>On the other hand, Lula may find some openings and allies among other countries that are concerned about the humanitarian and security implications of the war, as well as the risk of a wider confrontation between nuclear powers. He may also leverage his personal reputation and charisma, as well as Brazil's historical role as a promoter of dialogue and cooperation in global affairs.</p><p>Lula has already had some contacts with both Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who visited Brasilia on Monday. He has also discussed his plan with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is seen as a key player in any potential resolution of the crisis. Lula hopes to convene a meeting of his proposed "G20 for peace" soon, possibly in Brazil or another neutral venue.</p><h2>Lula's motivations and aspirations</h2><p>Lula's peace initiative reflects his motivations and aspirations as Brazil's president. He came back to power in 2023 after defeating far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro in a landslide victory. He promised to bring Brazil "back" to the world stage, after four years of isolationism and alignment with former US President Donald Trump.</p><p>Lula also wants to restore his own image and legacy, after being imprisoned on corruption charges that were later annulled by the Supreme Court. He sees himself as a global leader and a champion of democracy, human rights, and social justice. He has been critical of the US and the EU for their role in global issues such as climate change, trade, and human rights.</p><p>Lula may also have some personal and political reasons to pursue his peace initiative. He may want to show his independence and autonomy from Washington and Brussels, which have been pressuring him to adopt more sanctions against Venezuela and Cuba, two of his allies in Latin America. He may also want to boost his popularity and influence at home and abroad, ahead of the presidential election in 2026, when he may seek a third term or endorse a successor.</p><h6>Brazil, Lula, Ukraine, Russia, peace</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
