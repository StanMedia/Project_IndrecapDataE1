Tim Rietbergen, an evolutionary biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, identified the previously unknown bat species when he began collecting measurements and other data from museum specimens.</p><p>"This new research is a step forward in understanding what happened in terms of evolution and diversity back in the early days of bat," he said.</p><p>The newly discovered extinct bat species -— Icaronycteris gunnelli — was not much different from bats that fly around today. Its teeth revealed that it lived on a diet of insects. It was tiny, weighing in at only 25 grams (0.88 ounces).</p><p>"If it folds his wings next to its body, it would easily fit inside your hand. Its wings were relatively short and broad, reflecting a more fluttering flight style," Rietbergen said.</p><p>The research was published in the scientific journal PLOS One on Wednesday.</p><h2>Bats are an evolutionary mystery</h2><p>Today, there are more than 1,400 living bat species found all over the world, with the exception of polar regions. But how the creatures evolved to be the only mammal capable of powered flight isn't well understood.</p><p>The bat fossil record is patchy, and the two fossils Rietbergen identified as a new species were lucky finds — exceptionally well-preserved and revealing the animals' complete skeletons, including teeth.</p><p>"Bat skeletons are small, light and fragile, which is very unfavorable for the fossilization process. They simply do not preserve well," he said.</p><p>The two skeletons Rietbergen studied survived the eons likely because the creatures fell into a lake, putting them out of reach of predators and into an environment more conducive to fossilization. The ancient lake bed is part of Wyoming's Green River Formation and has yielded a number of bat fossils.</p><p>One of the two fossils was collected by a private collector in 2017 and purchased by the American Museum of Natural History. The other belonged to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and was found in 1994.</p><h2>Implications for bat evolution and diversity</h2><p>The discovery of Icaronycteris gunnelli adds to the knowledge of early bat evolution and diversity. The fossils date back to about 52 million years ago, when Earth's climate was warm and humid.</p><p>This was also a time when many groups of mammals diversified rapidly after the extinction of dinosaurs. Bats are among the most diverse mammals today, accounting for about 20% of all mammal species.</p><p>However, little is known about how bats originated and diversified. The oldest known bat fossils belong to two genera: Icaronycteris and Onychonycteris. Both genera have features that are intermediate between modern bats and their non-flying ancestors.</p><p>For example, they have claws on all five digits of their wings, unlike most modern bats that have claws only on their thumbs. They also have relatively long tails and legs, suggesting that they were less specialized for flight than modern bats.</p><p>Icaronycteris gunnelli belongs to the same genus as Icaronycteris index, another fossil bat species that was described in 1966. However, Rietbergen found that Icaronycteris gunnelli had some distinctive features that set it apart from Icaronycteris index.</p><p>For instance, it had smaller molars and larger canines than Icaronycteris index, indicating a different diet preference. It also had a shorter snout and a narrower skull than Icaronycteris index, suggesting a different cranial shape.</p><p>Rietbergen said that these differences show that there was already some variation within the genus Icaronycteris, which could have led to further diversification of bats over time.</p><p>He also said that finding more fossil bats from this period would help to understand how bats evolved their unique features such as echolocation, flight mechanics, and social behavior.</p><p>"Bats are fascinating animals that have many adaptations that make them successful in various environments. By studying their fossils, we can learn more about their origins and how they became so diverse," he said.</p><h6>Bat fossils, new species, evolution, diversity</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
