The male lion, named Loonkiito, was 19 years old and was described as frail by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).</p><p>Loonkiito had ventured into a village near the Amboseli National Park, a UNESCO biosphere reserve site near Mount Kilimanjaro, where he attacked a livestock pen. The owner of the livestock speared him to death in retaliation.</p><p>The killing of Loonkiito sparked outrage among conservationists and wildlife lovers, who mourned the loss of one of the last surviving lions from his generation. Loonkiito was part of a pride that had been monitored by conservation group Lion Guardians since 2004.</p><p>Lion Guardians said that Loonkiito was "starving" and had left the park due to the end of a drought that had made hunting difficult for wild animals. The group also said that the end of a drought is commonly marked by an increase in human-lion conflict, since wild prey becomes harder to hunt and livestock owners are "particularly vigilant" after losing so many animals.</p><p>Kenya has been experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, which has affected millions of people and animals. The drought has also forced many pastoralists to move their livestock closer to protected areas, increasing the risk of encounters with predators.</p><h2>Six more lions speared on Saturday</h2><p>The killing of Loonkiito was followed by another tragedy on Saturday, when six more lions were speared by herders after they killed 11 goats and one dog in Mbirikani area, Kajiado County. The lions were also part of the Amboseli ecosystem and had strayed out of the park.</p><p>The KWS said that the killing of six lions at once was "an unusually large number" and expressed concern over the escalating human-wildlife conflict in the region. The KWS also said that it had deployed rangers and veterinarians to the area to assess the situation and prevent further killings.</p><p>The KWS hosted a meeting on Saturday attended by locals and government officials to discuss the recent killings and explore ways to minimize the risk of human-wildlife conflict. The meeting also addressed the wider picture of community livelihoods and benefit sharing towards a harmonious coexistence in the open community and wildlife landscapes.</p><p>The KWS said that it would continue to work with local communities, conservation partners and other stakeholders to promote human-wildlife coexistence and mitigate conflict. The KWS also urged the public to report any incidents of wildlife attacks or threats to its toll-free hotline.</p><h2>Kenya's lions under threat</h2><p>Kenya is home to an estimated 2,000 lions, which are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The lion population has declined by about 43% in the past two decades due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, poaching and disease.</p><p>Human-wildlife conflict is one of the main threats facing Kenya's lions, as they often come into contact with people and livestock outside protected areas. According to a report by conservation group Born Free, more than 100 lions are killed every year in Kenya due to human-wildlife conflict.</p><p>The government and conservation groups have a compensation program for herders whose livestock is killed by wild animals. However, the program has been criticized for being slow, inadequate and prone to corruption. Some herders resort to killing predators as a form of revenge or deterrence.</p><p>Conservationists have called for more efforts to protect Kenya's lions and other wildlife, as well as to support local communities living alongside them. They have also advocated for more education and awareness on the importance of wildlife conservation and the benefits of ecotourism.</p><h2>Why Kenya's lion-human conflict intensifies</h2><p>Kenya's lion-human conflict is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been worsened by several factors, including drought, habitat loss, population growth, cultural practices and inadequate compensation.</p><p>Drought: Kenya has been experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, which has affected millions of people and animals. The drought has reduced the availability of water and vegetation for both livestock and wildlife, forcing them to compete for scarce resources. The drought has also forced many pastoralists to move their livestock closer to protected areas, increasing the risk of encounters with predators.</p><p>Habitat loss: Kenya's wildlife habitats have been shrinking due to human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, infrastructure development and charcoal production. According to a report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Kenya has lost 50% of its wildlife habitats in the past 50 years. Habitat loss reduces the space and prey for lions and other carnivores, making them more likely to stray into human settlements in search of food.</p><p>Population growth: Kenya's human population has grown rapidly in the past decades, reaching nearly 55 million in 2020. According to the United Nations, Kenya's population is projected to reach 95 million by 2050. Population growth increases the demand for land, food and water, putting more pressure on wildlife habitats and natural resources. Population growth also leads to more human-wildlife interactions and conflicts.</p><p>Cultural practices: Some communities in Kenya have cultural practices that involve killing lions and other wildlife as a form of revenge, deterrence or ritual. For example, some Maasai warriors kill lions as a rite of passage or a sign of bravery. Some Turkana herders kill lions as a form of compensation for their lost livestock. Some Pokot herders kill lions as a way of protecting their cattle from diseases. These practices are often driven by traditional beliefs, values and norms that are not compatible with wildlife conservation.</p><p>Inadequate compensation: The government and conservation groups have a compensation program for herders whose livestock is killed by wild animals. However, the program has been criticized for being slow, inadequate and prone to corruption. Some herders complain that they do not receive fair compensation for their losses, or that they have to wait for long periods of time to get paid. Some herders also allege that some officials demand bribes or falsify documents to deny them compensation. These grievances create resentment and frustration among the affected communities, who may resort to killing predators as a form of justice or protest.</p><h6>Lions, Kenya, human-wildlife conflict, conservation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
