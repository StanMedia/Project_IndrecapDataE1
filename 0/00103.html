It was also watched by millions of people across the U.K. and the Commonwealth, as well as around the world, on television and online.</p><p>The service followed a centuries-old ritual that dates back to the Anglo-Saxon times, but also incorporated some innovations and personal touches chosen by the King. It featured music from different genres and traditions, including classical, folk, gospel, and Greek Orthodox. It also included readings from the Bible and other sources, such as Shakespeare and Dylan Thomas.</p><p>The King wore a navy blue military uniform for the occasion, while the Queen Consort wore a cream-colored dress and coat with a matching hat. They arrived at the abbey in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, which was specially decorated with symbols of their heraldry and interests.</p><p>The King and Queen Consort entered the abbey through the Great West Door and proceeded to the Theatre, where they were presented to the congregation by the Archbishop of Canterbury. They then swore oaths to uphold the law and serve the people of their realms.</p><p>The King was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury on his hands, head, breast, and palms. He then received the symbols of his royal authority: the Sword of State, representing his role as defender of the faith; the Orb, representing his sovereignty over the world; the Sceptre with the Cross, representing his temporal power; and the Sceptre with the Dove, representing his spiritual guidance.</p><p>The climax of the service was when the King was crowned with St Edward's Crown, which is made of gold and adorned with precious stones. It is one of the oldest and most sacred objects in the coronation regalia and has been used for every coronation since Charles II in 1661. The King was then enthroned on King Edward's Chair, which contains the Stone of Scone, a symbol of Scottish heritage.</p><p>The Queen Consort was then crowned with a new crown made for her by Garrard &amp; Co., which features diamonds from her own collection and from those of her late mother-in-law, Diana, Princess of Wales. She also received a ring, a bracelet, and a pair of earrings as gifts from the King.</p><p>The King and Queen Consort then received homage from members of their family and other peers of the realm. They also offered prayers for themselves and their people. The service ended with a blessing from the Archbishop of Canterbury and a rendition of God Save The King.</p><h2>The celebrations</h2><p>After the coronation service, the King and Queen Consort left Westminster Abbey in an open carriage procession along The Mall to Buckingham Palace. They were escorted by members of the Household Cavalry and greeted by cheering crowds along the route. They also passed by several landmarks that were decorated with flags and flowers for the occasion.</p><p>At Buckingham Palace, they appeared on the balcony with other members of their family and waved to the spectators. They also witnessed a flypast by aircrafts from the Royal Air Force and a 41-gun salute by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.</p><p>The King then hosted a lunch reception for his guests at Buckingham Palace, where he gave a speech thanking them for their support and expressing his hopes for his reign. He also paid tribute to his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died on 8 September 2022 at Windsor Castle after a long illness.</p><p>In his speech, he said: "My mother dedicated her life to this country and to our Commonwealth family. She was an inspiration to us all and I will always strive to follow her example of service and duty. I am deeply grateful for your loyalty and affection towards her and towards me."</p><p>He added: "As I begin my reign as your King, I am mindful of the great responsibility that lies ahead. I am also hopeful for our future together. I believe that we have much to celebrate as a nation and as a family of nations. I also believe that we have much to contribute to the world as we face its many challenges."</p><p>He concluded: "I pledge to you my solemn oath to be a faithful and true King, to uphold the law and the constitution, to serve you and all my people with love and compassion, and to work for the common good of our country and our Commonwealth. May God bless us all and may God save the King."</p><p>The King and Queen Consort then left Buckingham Palace for Windsor Castle, where they hosted a dinner for their family and close friends. They also enjoyed a private concert by some of their favorite musicians, including Ed Sheeran, Adele, and Elton John.</p><p>The coronation day was marked by various events and festivities across the U.K. and the Commonwealth. There were street parties, concerts, fireworks, and special services in churches and other places of worship. There were also exhibitions, documentaries, and publications celebrating the life and achievements of the King.</p><p>The public were invited to join in the celebrations by taking part in various activities and initiatives. They were encouraged to plant trees in honor of the King's passion for the environment, to donate to charities that support his causes, and to make a pledge to serve their communities.</p><p>The coronation day was also declared a bank holiday in the U.K. and some other Commonwealth countries, giving people a chance to enjoy the occasion with their families and friends.</p><h2>The significance</h2><p>The coronation of King Charles III was a historic event that marked the end of one era and the beginning of another for the monarchy and the nation. It was the first coronation in 70 years, since Queen Elizabeth II was crowned on 2 June 1953. It was also the first coronation of a male monarch since George VI in 1937.</p><p>The coronation also signaled a change in the style and role of the monarchy in the 21st century. King Charles III is expected to be a more active and outspoken monarch than his mother, who was known for her discretion and neutrality. He is likely to use his influence and experience to promote his interests and views on various issues, such as climate change, interfaith dialogue, and social justice.</p><p>However, he will also face some challenges and controversies as he assumes his new position. He will have to balance his personal opinions with his constitutional duties as head of state. He will also have to deal with the public's expectations and perceptions of him and his family. He will also have to navigate the changing relationship between the U.K. and its former colonies, some of which may question his relevance and legitimacy as their head of state.</p><p>The coronation of King Charles III was therefore a momentous occasion that celebrated the continuity and evolution of the monarchy. It also raised some questions and opportunities for its future.</p><h6>King Charles III, coronation, Westminster Abbey, monarchy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
