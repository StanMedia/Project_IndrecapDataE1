It transported more than 200,000 enslaved people across the Atlantic Ocean, mainly to work on plantations in the Caribbean and North America.</p><p>The company also paid dividends to its shareholders, including members of the royal family and the aristocracy, from the profits made from selling enslaved people and exploiting their labour.</p><p>The document sheds new light on the extent of the monarchy's involvement and investment in the enslavement of African people, which has been largely overlooked or downplayed by historians.</p><h2>The research and the statement</h2><p>Buckingham Palace said that King Charles took the issue "profoundly seriously" and that he supported an independent research project exploring the links between the British monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade during the late 17th and 18th centuries.</p><p>The research project is being carried out by Camilla de Koning, a historian at the University of Manchester, in partnership with Historic Royal Palaces, a charity that manages several royal residences.</p><p>The project, which began in October 2020 and is expected to be completed in 2026, aims to examine how slavery shaped the lives, finances and politics of successive British monarchs and their households.</p><p>Buckingham Palace said that King Charles was supporting the research by granting access to the Royal Archives and the Royal Collection, which contain historical documents and artefacts related to the monarchy.</p><p>A spokesperson for the palace said: "This is an issue that His Majesty takes profoundly seriously. As His Majesty told the Commonwealth heads of government reception in Rwanda last year: 'I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact.'</p><p>"That process has continued with vigour and determination since His Majesty's accession. Historic Royal Palaces is a partner in an independent research project, which began in October last year, that is exploring, among other issues, the links between the British monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade during the late 17th and 18th centuries."</p><p>The spokesperson added: "As part of that drive, the royal household is supporting this research through access to the Royal Archives and the Royal Collection, which contain historical documents and artefacts related to the monarchy."</p><p>The Royal Archives, established in 1914, hold the official and private papers of the British monarchs and their households from the 17th century onwards. The Royal Collection, one of the largest and most important art collections in the world, includes paintings, drawings, prints, books, manuscripts, furniture, jewellery and other objects that reflect the tastes and interests of the royal family over centuries.</p><h2>The reaction and the context</h2><p>Historians and campaigners welcomed King Charles's statement but said more needed to be done to acknowledge and address the legacy of slavery and colonialism.</p><p>Dr Miranda Kaufmann, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies and an expert on black British history, said: "I think it's a positive step that King Charles is supporting this research and opening up the archives. It shows a willingness to engage with this difficult history and to confront it head-on."</p><p>She added: "But I think it's also important to recognise that this is not just about the past. It's about how slavery and colonialism have shaped the present, in terms of racial inequalities, economic disparities and cultural stereotypes. There needs to be a wider conversation about how we can address these issues and how we can learn from history to create a more just and inclusive society."</p><p>Dr Olivette Otele, a professor of history at the University of Bristol and the UK's first black female history professor, said: "I think it's commendable that King Charles is supporting this research and showing an interest in this topic. It's a sign of maturity and responsibility to acknowledge the role that the monarchy played in slavery and colonialism."</p><p>She added: "But I think it's also important to go beyond research and to think about how we can use this knowledge to educate people and to challenge racism and discrimination. We need to have more public engagement and more dialogue about this history and its implications for today. We need to have more representation and diversity in our institutions and our curriculum. We need to have more reparative justice and more solidarity with those who are still suffering from the effects of slavery and colonialism."</p><p>The Guardian's investigation into the monarchy's slavery connections is part of its Cost of the Crown series, which examines the history, finances and politics of the British monarchy.</p><p>The series has revealed that King Charles receives millions of pounds every year from his private estates, some of which have historical links to slavery. It has also revealed that King Charles has used his influence to lobby ministers on issues ranging from climate change to architecture.</p><p>The series has sparked debate about the role and relevance of the monarchy in modern Britain, as well as its accountability and transparency.</p><h6>King Charles, slavery, monarchy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
