The suspect, identified by police as K.K., was a seventh-grade student who used his father's gun to carry out the attack. He was arrested in the school yard after calling the police and surrendering.</p><p>According to police, the shooter had drawn sketches of classrooms and made a list of children he intended to target in a meticulously planned attack. He fired first at the teacher and then at the students who ducked under the desks. He also shot at a security guard who tried to stop him.</p><p>The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, but some reports suggest that the shooter may have been bullied or had mental health issues. He was described by his classmates as a quiet and good student who was not very sociable.</p><h2>The aftermath</h2><p>The shooting shocked Serbia, a country where mass shootings are extremely rare and gun laws are very strict. The government declared a day of national mourning on Thursday and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. President Aleksandar Vucic visited the school and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. He also announced that he would convene a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss measures to prevent such tragedies in the future.</p><p>The parents of the victims and the classmates of the shooter held a vigil outside the school on Wednesday night, lighting candles and laying flowers. Many expressed disbelief and grief over the loss of innocent lives. Some also called for more attention to the mental health of children and adolescents, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The injured children and teacher were taken to a nearby hospital, where they are receiving treatment. Their condition is reported to be stable but serious. The school will remain closed until further notice.</p><h2>The context</h2><p>Serbia is a country in the western Balkans that emerged from the wars and conflicts of the 1990s. It has a population of about seven million people and is a candidate for joining the European Union. It has faced political and economic challenges in recent years, as well as social problems such as poverty, corruption, and domestic violence.</p><p>Serbia has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in Europe, with an estimated 39.1 firearms per 100 people. However, most of these weapons are illegal and left over from the wars. The legal ownership of firearms requires a license, a background check, and a medical examination. The possession of automatic weapons is prohibited for civilians.</p><p>The last mass shooting in Serbia occurred in 2013, when a Balkan war veteran killed 13 people in a central Serbian village. The last school shooting in Serbia happened in 2002, when a student killed his teacher and wounded four classmates in Novi Sad.</p><h2>The gun culture and laws in Serbia</h2><p>Serbia is a country in the western Balkans that has a long history of gun ownership, especially in rural areas where hunting is a popular activity. Many families have inherited firearms from their ancestors or acquired them during the wars and conflicts of the 1990s, when Serbia fought against other ethnic groups that were part of the former Yugoslavia.</p><p>According to the 2018 Small Arms Survey, Serbia ranks third in the world after the United States and Yemen with an estimated 39 firearms per 100 people, along with its former federal partner Montenegro. However, most of these weapons are illegal and unregistered, posing a risk of misuse and trafficking.</p><p>Serbia also has strict gun laws that regulate the legal ownership and use of firearms. Individuals who want to own firearms must obtain a license from the Ministry of Interior, which conducts a thorough background check, a medical examination, and a training course. The license must be renewed every five years and can be revoked if the owner violates the law or is found to be irresponsible.</p><p>The legal ownership of firearms does not automatically allow the bearer to carry them outside the home. Concealed carry permits are very difficult to obtain and require a special justification. The possession of automatic weapons is prohibited for civilians.</p><p>Despite the strict laws, Serbia has witnessed several mass shootings in recent years, mostly committed by individuals with mental health problems or personal grievances. The most recent one occurred on Wednesday, when a 13-year-old boy opened fire at his school in Belgrade, killing eight children and a guard.</p><p>The government has declared a day of national mourning and announced that it will review the measures to prevent such tragedies in the future. The shooting has also sparked a debate about the mental health of children and adolescents, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h6>Serbia, school shooting, Belgrade, K.K., Vladislav Ribnikar, gun ownership, gun laws, gun culture</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
