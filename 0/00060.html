Kornmesser/European Southern Observatory</p><p>Astronomers reveal the origin of the brightest and most powerful objects in the universe after 60 years of mystery.</p><h2>What are quasars?</h2><p>Quasars are the brightest and most powerful objects in the universe. They can shine as brightly as a trillion stars packed into a volume the size of our solar system. They are also extremely distant, some of them billions of light-years away from Earth.</p><p>Quasars are powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. These black holes can have masses millions or billions of times that of our sun. They feed on gas and dust that surround them, creating a swirling disk of hot material that emits intense radiation.</p><p>Some quasars also produce jets of plasma that shoot out from the poles of the black hole at nearly the speed of light. These jets can extend for hundreds of thousands of light-years, creating radio waves that can be detected by telescopes on Earth.</p><p>Quasars are important to astrophysicists because they act as beacons to the earliest epochs in the history of the universe. By studying their properties and distribution, astronomers can learn about the formation and evolution of galaxies, black holes, and cosmic structures.</p><h2>How are quasars triggered?</h2><p>The mystery of what triggers quasars has puzzled astronomers for 60 years, since they were first discovered in 1963. Many theories have been proposed, such as gas inflows from galactic halos, interactions with nearby galaxies, or mergers of black holes.</p><p>Now, a new study led by scientists at the Universities of Sheffield and Hertfordshire has revealed that it is a consequence of galaxies colliding. The study was published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on April 25, 2023.</p><p>The researchers used deep imaging observations from the Isaac Newton Telescope in La Palma, Spain, to observe 48 galaxies that host quasars and compare them with over 100 galaxies that do not. They found that galaxies hosting quasars are three times as likely to be interacting or colliding with other galaxies.</p><p>The collisions drive gas towards the supermassive black holes at the galaxy centers, fueling their activity and creating quasars. The researchers estimate that a typical quasar lasts for about 100 million years, which is a short time compared to the age of the universe.</p><p>The ignition of a quasar can have dramatic consequences for entire galaxies. It can drive the rest of the gas out of the galaxy, which prevents it from forming new stars for billions of years into the future. This can affect the evolution and fate of galaxies in the long term.</p><h2>What are some examples of quasars?</h2><p>One example of a quasar is P172+18, which was discovered in 2021 by astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. It is one of the most distant and oldest quasars ever found, dating back to 780 million years after the Big Bang.</p><p>P172+18 has a supermassive black hole with a mass of about 300 million times that of our sun. It also has powerful radio jets that indicate a high level of activity. The astronomers suspect that P172+18 was triggered by a collision between two young and gas-rich galaxies in the early universe.</p><p>Another example is 3C 273, which was the first quasar ever identified in 1963 by astronomer Maarten Schmidt. It is located about 2.4 billion light-years away from Earth and has a supermassive black hole with a mass of about 700 million times that of our sun.</p><p>3C 273 is one of the brightest quasars in the sky, visible with a small telescope. It also has a prominent jet that extends for about 200,000 light-years. The jet is believed to be caused by a strong magnetic field around the black hole that accelerates charged particles.</p><h2>What are the implications of quasar research?</h2><p>The discovery of quasar triggers has significant implications for our understanding of how galaxies and black holes evolve over cosmic time. It also sheds light on how quasars affect their environments and influence the formation of stars and planets.</p><p>Professor Clive Tadhunter, from the University of Sheffield's Department of Physics and Astronomy, said: "Quasars are one of the most extreme phenomena in the universe, and what we see is likely to represent the future of our own Milky Way galaxy when it collides with the Andromeda galaxy in about five billion years."</p><p>"It's exciting to observe these events and finally understand why they occur — but thankfully Earth won't be anywhere near one of these apocalyptic episodes for quite some time."</p><h2>What will happen to our galaxy?</h2><p>The collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda is inevitable, as they are bound by gravity and moving towards each other at about 110 kilometers per second. However, this does not mean that our solar system will be destroyed or even significantly affected by the event.</p><p>The stars in both galaxies are so far apart that the chances of any direct collisions are extremely low. The sun and its planets will likely be flung into a new region of the merged galaxy, possibly farther from the center than they are now. The night sky will also change dramatically, as Andromeda will grow larger and brighter over billions of years, eventually filling the entire sky.</p><p>The main danger for our solar system comes from the gravitational perturbations caused by the passing stars and gas clouds. These could alter the orbits of planets, asteroids, and comets, potentially increasing the risk of impacts or ejections. However, these effects are expected to be minor and unlikely to threaten life on Earth.</p><p>The collision will also affect the supermassive black holes at the centers of both galaxies. They will spiral towards each other and eventually merge, creating a larger black hole with a mass of about 1.5 billion times that of our sun. The merger will release enormous amounts of gravitational waves that will ripple through space-time. The black hole will also consume some of the surrounding gas and dust, creating a bright flare of radiation that could be detected by future telescopes.</p><p>The collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda is a rare and spectacular event that will reshape our cosmic neighborhood. It will also provide a unique opportunity to study how galaxies evolve and interact over time. As astronomers continue to observe and simulate this process, they hope to gain more insights into the origin and destiny of our galaxy and its inhabitants.</p><h6>Quasar, Galaxy collision, Supermassive black hole</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
