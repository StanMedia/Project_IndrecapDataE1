It was created by Congress in 1917 to give the Treasury Department a blanket authorization to borrow money up to a set amount without having to seek approval each time.</p><p>The debt ceiling is not a cap on government spending, which is determined by Congress through the annual budget process. Rather, it is a limit on how much the government can borrow to finance the spending that Congress has already authorized.</p><p>The current debt ceiling is $31.4 trillion, which was reached in December 2021. Since then, the Treasury Department has been using accounting tricks, or "extraordinary measures", to keep paying the government's bills without exceeding the limit. But those measures will run out soon, possibly by early June, according to the latest estimate by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p><p>If Congress does not raise or suspend the debt ceiling by then, the U.S. government will face a default on its debt obligations, which could have severe consequences for the economy and financial markets.</p><h2>Why is there a political deadlock over the debt ceiling?</h2><p>Raising or suspending the debt ceiling used to be a fairly routine vote in Congress, but in recent years it has become a source of partisan conflict and brinkmanship.</p><p>Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, have demanded spending cuts or other policy concessions from Democrats, who control the Senate and the White House, in exchange for raising or suspending the debt ceiling. Democrats have refused to negotiate over the debt limit, arguing that it is a matter of paying for what Congress has already agreed to spend and that defaulting on the debt would be irresponsible and catastrophic.</p><p>The last time Congress faced a similar standoff over the debt ceiling was in 2011, when Republicans threatened to block an increase unless Democrats agreed to a deficit-reduction plan. The impasse lasted for months and resulted in a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, a first in history. It also triggered automatic spending cuts known as sequestration, which affected many government programs and services.</p><p>In 2013, another debt ceiling crisis led to a partial government shutdown for 16 days, as Republicans tried to use the leverage of the debt limit to defund or delay the implementation of President Barack Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Since then, Congress has raised or suspended the debt ceiling several times, often at the last minute or after temporary extensions. The most recent increase was in 2021, when Congress approved a $2.5 trillion hike as part of a bipartisan coronavirus relief package.</p><h2>What are the consequences of not raising or suspending the debt ceiling?</h2><p>If Congress fails to act before the Treasury Department runs out of extraordinary measures, the U.S. government will not be able to borrow any more money and will have to rely on its cash reserves and incoming revenues to pay its bills.</p><p>However, those sources may not be enough to cover all of the government's obligations, which include interest payments on the debt, Social Security benefits, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, military salaries and pensions, tax refunds, and many other programs and services that millions of Americans depend on.</p><p>According to some estimates, if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended by early June, the government will face a cash shortfall of about $150 billion per month. That means it will have to prioritize some payments over others or delay some payments altogether.</p><p>Either way, failing to pay all of the government's bills on time and in full would amount to a default on its debt obligations, which could have serious repercussions for both domestic and international creditors.</p><p>A default could also undermine confidence in the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and trigger a spike in interest rates for both public and private borrowing. That could lead to higher costs for consumers and businesses, lower economic growth, reduced tax revenues, and more fiscal pressure for the government.</p><p>Moreover, a default could damage the reputation and credibility of the U.S. as a reliable borrower and a global leader. It could also spark political turmoil and social unrest at home and abroad.</p><h2>What are some possible solutions or scenarios for resolving the debt ceiling crisis?</h2><p>There are several options or scenarios that could prevent or end a debt ceiling crisis:</p><ul><li>Congress could raise or suspend the debt ceiling before it becomes a problem. This would require bipartisan cooperation and compromise between Democrats and Republicans.</li><li>President Biden could invoke Section 4 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which states that "the validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned." Some legal scholars have argued that this clause gives the president authority to ignore or override the debt ceiling and order the Treasury Department to continue borrowing as needed. However, this option is controversial and untested in court.</li><li>The Federal Reserve could intervene and buy Treasury bonds directly from the Treasury Department with newly created money. This would effectively bypass Congress and allow the government to finance its spending without increasing its debt subject to limit. However, this option would violate current laws and norms that prohibit direct monetary financing of fiscal deficits.</li><li>The Treasury Department could issue platinum coins with arbitrary face values (such as $1 trillion) and deposit them at the Federal Reserve as legal tender. This would create new money out of thin air and increase the Treasury's cash balance without increasing its debt subject to limit. However, this option would also violate current laws and norms that regulate coinage and seigniorage.</li><li>The U.S. government could default on some or all of its debt obligations, either selectively or across-the-board. This would be an unprecedented and extreme outcome that would likely trigger legal challenges, financial chaos, and political backlash.</li></ul><h6>Debt ceiling, national debt, default, extraordinary measures, bipartisan, compromise</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
