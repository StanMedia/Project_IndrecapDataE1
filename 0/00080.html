The ruling Colorado Party has dominated Paraguayan politics for the last three-quarters of a century, in power for all but five years. But persistent corruption allegations have led to cracks appearing in their support.</p><p>"We never talked about politics before, because a win for the Colorado Party was a done deal," 40-year-old bank worker Gustavo Vera told Reuters in the capital. "There's an air of change, the people have woken up."</p><p>At the bustling Mercado 4 street market in Asuncion, most cited the tough economic situation. The fiscal deficit ballooned to 3% of GDP last year, average annual growth in the last four years dipped to 0.7%, and extreme poverty has risen.</p><p>"We're going backwards, that is how I feel," said Nicolas Ortigoza, 32, as he served chicken skewers at his stall. "There's more corruption in Paraguay than work... All I know is we have to work much harder to make ends meet."</p><p>Whoever takes over the presidency in August is likely to come under pressure from the newly-elected legislature to reduce spending after a splurge to ease the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. Alegre has pledged to cut energy bills and Pena has promised to create more jobs.</p><p>"Whoever wins is going to have to limit public spending because debt cannot continue to grow," economist and former finance minister Cesar Barreto told Reuters, adding it was a "complex" moment for any new government.</p><h2>Taiwan and China loom large in foreign policy debate</h2><p>In political newscasts and columns, talk has centered on the debate about whether to end long-term diplomatic relations with Taiwan in favor of China, and a string of graft allegations against key Colorado Party leaders.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury earlier this year imposed sanctions on party chief Horacio Cartes and Vice President Hugo Velazquez, citing "rampant corruption." They both deny the charges.</p><p>Alegre has said he would cut ties with Taiwan if he wins and recognize China instead, following the example of other Latin American countries such as Panama and El Salvador. He argues that China is a more important trade partner and investor for Paraguay than Taiwan.</p><p>Pena has defended maintaining relations with Taiwan, saying it is a matter of principle and sovereignty. He has also accused Alegre of being influenced by Venezuela's socialist government, which backs China.</p><p>Paraguay is one of only 15 countries that recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must eventually be reunited with the mainland.</p><p>Taiwan has been providing aid and investment to Paraguay for decades, especially in health, education and infrastructure. It has also donated vaccines and medical supplies to help Paraguay cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>China has been expanding its economic and political influence in Latin America in recent years, offering loans, trade deals and infrastructure projects. It has also been pressuring countries to sever ties with Taiwan.</p><p>The choice between Taiwan and China could have significant implications for Paraguay's foreign policy and development prospects. Some analysts say that switching recognition could open up new opportunities for trade and investment with China, while others warn that it could jeopardize Paraguay's sovereignty and democratic values.</p><h2>The roots and forms of corruption in Paraguay</h2><p>Paraguay has a long history of corruption that affects all branches and levels of government and undermines democracy and development.</p><p>Corruption in Paraguay is endemic and systemic and takes place in all three branches of government as well as in the state and bi-national enterprises. It is perceived as pervasive, touching many aspects of the lives of its citizens, both rich and poor.</p><p>Corruption in Paraguay has deep historical roots that can be traced back to the colonial period and the post-independence era, when political and economic power was concentrated in the hands of a few elites who used patronage and clientelism to maintain their dominance.</p><p>Corruption became an art form under the Alfredo Stroessner military dictatorship (1954-1989), when military officials helped organize and participated in the narcotics and contraband trade with complete impunity. Stroessner also used public funds to buy political loyalty and silence dissent.</p><p>After the transition to democracy in 1989, corruption remained widespread and entrenched, as the ruling Colorado Party continued to control most state institutions and resources. Successive governments have failed to implement effective anti-corruption reforms or prosecute high-level offenders.</p><p>Some of the main forms of corruption in Paraguay include:</p><ul><li>Bribery: Public officials often demand or accept bribes to provide services, award contracts, grant licenses, or overlook irregularities. Businesses also resort to bribes to gain access to markets, avoid taxes, or influence regulations.</li><li>Embezzlement: Public funds are frequently diverted or misappropriated by public officials for personal gain or political purposes. State-owned enterprises and bi-national entities are particularly vulnerable to embezzlement due to weak oversight and transparency.</li><li>Money laundering: Paraguay is a major transit point for illicit money flows from drug trafficking, smuggling, tax evasion, and other criminal activities. Money laundering occurs through banks, casinos, real estate, trade-based schemes, and other sectors.</li><li>Nepotism: Public officials often abuse their power to appoint relatives or cronies to public positions or favor them in public procurement. Nepotism undermines meritocracy and accountability in the public sector.</li><li>Influence peddling: Public officials often use their influence or connections to benefit themselves or their associates in exchange for money or favors. Influence peddling affects the independence and integrity of public institutions.</li></ul><h2>The impacts and challenges of corruption in Paraguay</h2><p>Corruption in Paraguay has serious negative impacts on the country's political, economic, social, and environmental development. Some of the main impacts include:</p><ul><li>Undermining democracy: Corruption erodes public trust and confidence in democratic institutions and processes. It also fuels political instability, polarization, and violence. Corruption also limits civic participation and media freedom, as citizens face intimidation or repression for denouncing or exposing corruption.</li><li>Hindering economic growth: Corruption distorts market competition and creates inefficiencies and uncertainties for businesses. It also reduces public revenues and investments, affecting the quality and availability of public goods and services. Corruption also discourages foreign direct investment and trade opportunities.</li><li>Increasing poverty and inequality: Corruption exacerbates poverty and inequality by diverting resources from social programs and infrastructure that benefit the poor and marginalized groups. It also increases the cost of living and reduces access to education, health care, justice, and other basic rights.</li><li>Damaging the environment: Corruption facilitates environmental crimes such as illegal logging, mining, fishing, wildlife trafficking, and deforestation. It also hampers environmental regulation and enforcement, leading to pollution, degradation, and loss of biodiversity.</li></ul><p>Paraguay faces many challenges in combating corruption effectively. Some of the main challenges include:</p><ul><li>Weak legal framework: The anti-corruption legal framework of Paraguay criminalizes passive and active corruption, money laundering, embezzlement and other offenses but does not cover abuse of office or the bribery of foreign officials. Furthermore, implementation of the existing legislation is weak, and many government officials engage in corruption with impunity.</li><li>Lack of political will: The political elite lacks the commitment and willingness to tackle corruption seriously. Many politicians are either involved in or benefit from corrupt practices. Anti-corruption initiatives are often superficial or selective, aiming to appease public opinion or target political opponents.</li><li>Low institutional capacity: The institutions responsible for preventing, investigating, prosecuting, and sanctioning corruption are understaffed, underfunded, undertrained, politicized, or captured by vested interests. They also face interference or resistance from powerful actors who seek to obstruct their work.</li><li>Limited social oversight: The civil society organizations, media outlets, academic institutions, private sector associations, and other actors that monitor and expose corruption lack the resources, access, protection, and influence to effectively challenge the status quo. They also face legal and practical obstacles to obtain public information or participate in decision-making processes.</li></ul><h6>Paraguay; election; corruption; Taiwan; China</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
