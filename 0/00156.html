The deal is expected to close in June and will add GIFs and reaction stickers to Shutterstock's library of over 400 million images, videos, music tracks and other assets. Shutterstock said the acquisition will also expand its access to Giphy's 1.7 billion users across social media, messaging apps and websites.</p><h2>The background</h2><p>The deal comes after UK antitrust regulators forced Meta, formerly known as Facebook, to sell Giphy last year. Meta had bought Giphy for a reported $315 million in 2020, but the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that the acquisition would harm competition in digital advertising and social media markets. The CMA said that Giphy had competed with Meta in supplying GIFs to other platforms such as Snapchat, Twitter and TikTok, and that Meta could use Giphy's data to further increase its market power and squeeze out rivals.</p><p>The CMA ordered Meta to sell Giphy to an approved buyer by September 2023 or face a possible breakup of its UK operations. Meta appealed the decision, but a UK court upheld the CMA's ruling in November 2022. Meta then said it would comply with the order and sell Giphy.</p><h2>The implications</h2><p>The deal marks a significant loss for Meta, which had hoped to integrate Giphy into its family of apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Meta had argued that its acquisition of Giphy would benefit consumers and creators by providing more choice and innovation in GIFs. Meta also said that it did not use Giphy's data for advertising purposes and that it would continue to provide Giphy's services to other platforms.</p><p>However, the deal could be a win for Shutterstock, which has been diversifying its offerings beyond stock photos to include editorial images, video editing tools, music licensing and e-commerce solutions. Shutterstock said that Giphy's content and technology will complement its existing products and enable it to offer more engaging and personalized experiences to its customers.</p><p>The deal could also have implications for the future of GIFs, which have become a popular form of expression and communication online. According to Shutterstock, more than 10 billion GIFs are shared every day on Giphy's platform. Shutterstock said it will continue to support Giphy's community of artists, creators and partners, and that it will invest in developing new features and formats for GIFs.</p><h6>Shutterstock, Giphy, Meta, UK antitrust</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
