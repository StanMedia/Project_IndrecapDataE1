Emergency services were called to the scene around 10:40 a.m. local time, but could not find any trace of him.</p><p>Police said they recovered two items of interest from the water: a piece of wetsuit material and some small pieces of white polystyrene, possibly from his surfboard. The surfboard had a large bite mark on it, according to Trevlyn Smith, a unit manager from SES.</p><p>The search for Baccanello was suspended on Sunday evening due to poor weather conditions and high tide. Police said they would continue to search the area and surrounding beaches in the coming days, after consulting with his family.</p><h2>The victim</h2><p>Baccanello was a well-respected and loved teacher who had moved to Elliston in January this year. He had previously taught at Pulteney Grammar School in Adelaide between 2007 and 2009, and then 2022.</p><p>His family issued a statement saying his death was a "tragic loss" and thanked the community for their support.</p><p>"He is well remembered by the school community as a fine teacher, a generous friend and a genuine, authentic human being," Pulteney Grammar School said in a Facebook post.</p><p>Elliston Area School principal Chad Fleming said Baccanello had a keenness to build relationships with his students and make them feel good.</p><p>"He had a real passion for surfing and he shared that with his students as well," Fleming told CNN affiliate 9 News.</p><h2>The shark</h2><p>The species and size of the shark that attacked Baccanello are unknown. Shark attacks are relatively rare off South Australia - according to the Australian Shark Incident Database, there were 20 shark encounters in 2022, resulting in 14 injuries and one death. South Australia only contributed one case that did not involve any injury.</p><p>In February this year, a 16-year-old girl was killed by a shark while swimming in a river in Perth, Western Australia.</p><p>Shark experts say that most shark attacks are not intentional, but rather cases of mistaken identity or curiosity. They advise people to avoid swimming or surfing near seal colonies, river mouths, or areas with fish schools, as these are likely to attract sharks.</p><p>They also recommend wearing bright or contrasting colors, staying in groups, and avoiding the water at dawn or dusk, when sharks are more active.</p><h2>The risk</h2><p>Shark attacks on humans are still relatively rare occurrences, despite their terrifying reputation. According to the Australian Shark Incident Database, there were 20 shark encounters in 2022, resulting in 14 injuries and one death. Most of these incidents occurred in New South Wales and Western Australia, while South Australia only had one case that did not involve any injury.</p><p>Sharks do not hunt humans as their preferred prey, but rather attack them out of curiosity or confusion. Humans are not part of their natural diet, and they would much rather feed on fish and marine mammals. Sharks are opportunistic feeders that may investigate any potential food source in their vicinity, especially if it is splashing or making noise.</p><p>Most shark attacks happen when humans are swimming or surfing near seal colonies, river mouths, or areas with fish schools, as these are likely to attract sharks. Sharks are also more active at dawn or dusk, when their vision is impaired and they rely more on their other senses. Wearing bright or contrasting colors, staying in groups, and avoiding the water at these times may reduce the risk of shark attacks.</p><p>Sharks are a valuable part of marine ecosystems, but they face many threats from humans, such as overfishing, habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. Sharks are hunted for their meat, fins, skin, and organs, which are used for various products such as shark fin soup, lubricants, and leather. Some shark species are endangered or vulnerable due to their low reproductive rates and slow growth. Protecting sharks and their habitats is essential for maintaining the balance of life in the ocean.</p><h6>Shark attack, South Australia, Simon Baccanello</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
