They were found guilty of trafficking a young man from Lagos to the UK to provide a kidney for their daughter Sonia, who suffers from deteriorating kidneys and needs regular dialysis.</p><p>The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was offered a reward of up to £7,000 ($8,810) and the promise of work in the UK, but was unaware that he was expected to provide a kidney in return. He was brought to the UK by Dr. Obinna Obeta, who was also convicted of trafficking and sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p><p>The planned transplant was scheduled to take place at the private renal unit at London's Royal Free hospital in March 2022, but was called off by a medical consultant who became suspicious of the circumstances surrounding it. The victim fled, sleeping rough for days before reporting the plan to UK police last May.</p><h2>The reaction</h2><p>The case has sparked outrage and condemnation from human rights groups and anti-trafficking campaigners, who described it as a "horrific plot" and a "despicable trade" that treated human beings and their bodies as commodities.</p><p>Joanne Jakymec, Chief Crown Prosecutor, said: "This was an horrific plot to exploit a vulnerable victim by trafficking him to the UK for the purpose of transplanting his kidney. The convicted defendants showed utter disregard for the victim's welfare, health and well-being and used their considerable influence to exert a high degree of control throughout, with the victim having limited understanding of what was really going on here."</p><p>Detective Inspector Esther Richardson, from the Met's Modern Slavery and Exploitation Command said: "This is a landmark conviction and we commend the victim for his bravery in speaking against these offenders."</p><p>Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson, who presided over the trial and sentencing, said: "The harvesting of human organs is a form of slavery. It treats human beings and their bodies as commodities to be bought and sold." He pointed out that Ike Ekweremadu had been part of the Nigerian senate when it outlawed organ trafficking. He said: "You played a leading role in the offending. You did so in order to secure the material advantage, namely a human kidney for your daughter. I am sure that you are the driving force throughout." He added: "Your conviction represents a very substantial fall from grace."</p><h2>The background</h2><p>Organ trafficking is a global problem that affects thousands of people every year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 10,000 organs are illegally obtained each year through trafficking networks. The demand for organs far exceeds the supply, creating a lucrative black market where vulnerable people are exploited by brokers, middlemen and transplant tourists.</p><p>The WHO defines organ trafficking as "the recruitment, transport, transfer, harbouring or receipt of living or deceased persons or their organs by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the transfer of control over the potential donor, for the purpose of exploitation by removing organs for transplantation."</p><p>Organ trafficking is often linked to other forms of human trafficking, such as sex trafficking, forced labour and child trafficking. Victims are usually poor, marginalized or desperate people who are lured by false promises of money, jobs or education. They may also be coerced or deceived by family members or acquaintances who are involved in the trade. Some victims may not even be aware that they have been trafficked until they wake up missing an organ.</p><p>Organ trafficking is illegal in most countries and violates international human rights law and medical ethics. However, it is difficult to detect and prosecute due to its clandestine nature and the involvement of powerful actors such as politicians, doctors and criminal gangs. The lack of regulation and transparency in organ donation and transplantation systems also facilitates organ trafficking.</p><h2>The implications</h2><p>The case of Ike Ekweremadu and his co-conspirators is not only a shocking example of organ trafficking, but also a symptom of a wider problem of corruption and illicit wealth among Nigerian politicians. According to Matthew Page, a former US intelligence analyst and a Nigeria expert at the Chatham House thinktank, Ekweremadu had amassed an international property portfolio worth more than £6m, far exceeding his official income as a political office holder.</p><p>Page said he had warned the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate Ekweremadu's activities in the UK before the organ trafficking plot was uncovered. He said he had found evidence that Ekweremadu had used unexplained wealth to buy three properties in the UK and to fund expensive private education for his four children. He said the plot could have been foiled if UK authorities had acted on his warnings and a dossier of material about Ekweremadu's activities in Britain.</p><p>He said: "Clearly the UK authorities had ample opportunity to scrutinise Ekweremadu's UK activities before things reached the point of people-trafficking or organ harvesting. This case shows what can happen if such documented suspicions about corruption are ignored."</p><p>Ekweremadu denies any corruption and claims he acquired his wealth through legitimate means. He has also received support from some of Nigeria's political elite, who wrote to the UK court appealing for leniency ahead of his sentencing. Among them were Nigeria's former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the President of the Nigerian Senate Ahmad Lawan, and the Speaker of Nigeria's House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila.</p><p>They described Ekweremadu as "a brilliant lawyer, a distinguished public servant and a dedicated family man" who was desperate to help his sick daughter. They also argued that he had contributed to Nigeria's democracy and development and had been involved in peace and reconciliation efforts in the country.</p><p>However, their pleas did not sway Mr Justice Johnson, who said Ekweremadu's conviction represented "a very substantial fall from grace". He also noted that Ekweremadu had been part of the Nigerian senate when it outlawed organ trafficking and should have known better than to engage in such a crime.</p><h2>The conclusion</h2><p>The case of Ike Ekweremadu and his co-conspirators is a rare and disturbing example of organ trafficking that exposes the vulnerability of poor and marginalized people who are exploited by powerful and wealthy actors. It also reveals the challenges and gaps in detecting and prosecuting such crimes, which often involve cross-border networks and complex legal issues.</p><p>The case also highlights the need for more effective measures to combat corruption and illicit wealth among Nigerian politicians, who have been accused of plundering the country's resources and undermining its development. According to Transparency International, Nigeria ranks 149th out of 180 countries in its Corruption Perceptions Index 2022, with a score of 25 out of 100.</p><p>The case also raises questions about the role and responsibility of the UK authorities in preventing and addressing organ trafficking and other forms of modern slavery, especially when they involve foreign nationals who may have links or interests in the UK. The UK has been praised for its Modern Slavery Act 2015, which provides a comprehensive legal framework to tackle slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking. However, some critics have argued that the act has not been fully implemented or enforced, and that more needs to be done to protect victims and prosecute perpetrators.</p><p>The case also calls for more awareness and education among the public and the medical community about organ trafficking and its consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines and principles for ethical organ donation and transplantation, which aim to ensure respect for human dignity and rights, prevent exploitation and coercion, promote transparency and accountability, and safeguard health and safety. The WHO also urges countries to develop effective national systems for organ donation and transplantation that are based on voluntary consent, altruism and solidarity.</p><p>Organ trafficking is a grave violation of human rights that harms individuals, communities and societies. It is a crime that must be stopped by all means possible.</p><h6>Organ trafficking, Modern Slavery Act, Nigeria, UK</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
