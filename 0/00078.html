The state visit comes one week before Biden hosts Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and weeks before Biden is expected to travel to the region himself.</p><h3>A nuclear submarine visit</h3><p>One of the most significant aspects of the declaration is that the US " (intends) to take steps to make our deterrence more visible through the regular deployment of strategic assets, including a US nuclear ballistic submarine visit to South Korea, which has not happened since the early 1980s," the official said.</p><p>Officials made clear that such assets will not be stationed permanently, and there is "no plan" to deploy any tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula. However, the submarine visit is seen as a strong signal of US commitment and capability to defend its ally against any nuclear attack from North Korea.</p><p>A nuclear-armed submarine can carry up to 24 Trident II D5 missiles, each with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) that can deliver multiple warheads to different targets. The submarine can also operate stealthily and launch missiles from underwater, making it harder for adversaries to detect and intercept.</p><p>The last time a US nuclear-armed submarine visited South Korea was in 1982, when the USS Ohio docked at Busan as part of a show of force during a period of heightened tensions with North Korea. Since then, the US has avoided sending such submarines to South Korea, partly due to concerns about provoking China and Russia, which also have nuclear submarines in the region.</p><h3>A Nuclear Consultative Group</h3><p>Another key element of the declaration is the creation of the "US-ROK Nuclear Consultative Group," which will convene regularly to consult on nuclear and strategic planning issues, with the hope that it will give allies "additional insight in how we think about planning for major contingencies," the official said.</p><p>The group is modeled after US engagement with European allies during the height of the Cold War, when NATO established a Nuclear Planning Group to coordinate nuclear policy and strategy among its members.</p><p>The group will also address South Korea's concerns about its own nuclear capabilities and options in response to North Korea's growing arsenal. Earlier this year, President Yoon spoke about possibly deploying US tactical missiles on the Korean peninsula or even developing the country's own set of nuclear weapons.</p><p>However, both options face significant political and technical challenges. Deploying US tactical missiles would require Seoul's consent and could violate existing agreements with Pyongyang. Developing South Korea's own nuclear weapons would violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and could trigger sanctions from other countries.</p><p>The Nuclear Consultative Group could provide a platform for South Korea to voice its views and interests on these issues, as well as seek reassurance from the US that it will uphold its security commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty.</p><h3>A stronger alliance</h3><p>The declaration also includes other measures to strengthen the US-South Korea alliance, such as enhancing their joint military training, exercises and simulation activities; improving their information sharing and intelligence cooperation; and expanding their collaboration on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology and quantum computing.</p><p>The declaration also reaffirms their shared values of democracy, human rights and rule of law; their support for peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula; and their commitment to cooperate on regional and global issues such as climate change, pandemic response and cyber security.</p><p>Biden and Yoon also announced a new partnership on COVID-19 vaccine production and distribution, with the goal of expanding global vaccine supply and ensuring equitable access for low- and middle-income countries. The US will provide raw materials and technology to South Korea, which will use its manufacturing capacity to produce vaccines for domestic and international use.</p><p>The leaders also discussed ways to enhance their economic ties, such as through a new trade dialogue mechanism, a joint investment initiative, and a clean energy partnership. They also agreed to work together to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region and to counter China's growing influence and assertiveness in the area.</p><p>The state visit was marked by warm personal interactions between Biden and Yoon, who have both experienced personal tragedies in their lives. Biden expressed his condolences for the recent death of Yoon's mother, while Yoon thanked Biden for his support after the death of his son in 2019.</p><p>Biden also praised Yoon's leadership and vision, calling him a "champion of democracy" and a "close friend." Yoon reciprocated by saying that Biden is "a leader who is loved by everyone around the world" and that he has "renewed hope" for the alliance.</p><p>The visit concluded with a state dinner at the White House, where Biden toasted Yoon with a Korean phrase meaning "cheers to our friendship" and Yoon toasted Biden with an Irish proverb meaning "may the road rise up to meet you."</p><h2>The Washington Declaration</h2><p>The Washington Declaration is a joint statement issued by President Joe Biden and President Yoon Suk Yeol on April 26, 2023, to mark the 70th anniversary of the US-ROK Alliance. The declaration outlines a series of new measures to strengthen the alliance and deter North Korea's nuclear threat.</p><p>The declaration consists of four main sections:</p><ul><li>A reaffirmation of the US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty and the US commitment to extended deterrence, including the consultation with the ROK on any possible nuclear weapons employment on the Korean Peninsula.</li><li>A creation of a new Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) to enhance dialogue and information sharing on nuclear and strategic planning issues, and to manage the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program.</li><li>A commitment to make deterrence more visible through the regular deployment of strategic assets, including a US nuclear ballistic submarine visit to South Korea, which has not happened since the early 1980s.</li><li>A pledge to strengthen joint military training, exercises and simulation activities; improve information sharing and intelligence cooperation; and expand collaboration on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology and quantum computing.</li></ul><p>The declaration also reaffirms the shared values of democracy, human rights and rule of law; the support for peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula; and the cooperation on regional and global issues such as climate change, pandemic response and cyber security.</p><p>The declaration concludes with a recognition of the close friendship and kinship between the two nations, and a toast to their future partnership.</p><h6>US, South Korea, North Korea, nuclear, submarine</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
