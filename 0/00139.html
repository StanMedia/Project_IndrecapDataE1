According to a study published in Science Advances on Wednesday, these smoke emissions may have had far-reaching consequences for the global climate system.</p><p>The study, led by scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the United States, used new modeling to demonstrate how the smoke emissions may have shifted weather patterns. They found that the smoke aerosols brightened cloud decks over the southeastern Pacific Ocean, which absorbed radiation from the sun and cooled surface water temperatures. These disruptions may have helped trigger the rare three-year La Niña event, that brings wetter and cooler conditions to some regions and drier and warmer conditions to others.</p><p>La Niña is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the surface waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean cool down, affecting the atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns around the world. La Niña typically lasts for one or two years, but sometimes it can persist for longer periods. The recent La Niña event stretched from late 2020 to early 2023 - an unusually long duration that created a series of devastating tropical cyclones and intense hurricanes in some places and exacerbated drought in others.</p><p>Australia was also dragged to extremes, suffering historic rainfall and floods over that period. "Many people quickly forgot about the Australian fires, especially as the COVID pandemic exploded, but the Earth system has a long memory, and the impacts of the fires lingered for years," said NCAR scientist John Fasullo, lead author of the study.</p><h2>The role of volcanoes and wildfires</h2><p>Scientists have previously established that large volcanic eruptions in the Southern Hemisphere can shift the odds toward the formation of La Niña. In such instances, smoke high in the atmosphere results in the formation of light-reflecting particles called aerosols, which can cool the climate and ultimately create favorable conditions for La Niña.</p><p>The study by NCAR scientists suggests that smoke emissions from wildfires can have a similar effect, although through a different mechanism. Instead of injecting aerosols into the upper atmosphere, wildfires produce aerosols that are mostly confined to the lower atmosphere. These aerosols can enhance cloud formation and reflectivity, which can also cool and dry the air in some regions.</p><p>The study said that the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires were "exceptional in both their severity and particulate emissions," releasing smoke levels similar to a major volcanic eruption. The researchers used a sophisticated climate model that accounted for both aerosol-cloud interactions and ocean-atmosphere feedbacks to simulate how these emissions may have influenced La Niña.</p><p>They found that the smoke emissions increased cloud cover over the southeastern Pacific Ocean by about 10%, which reduced solar radiation reaching the ocean surface by about 20 watts per square meter. This cooling effect propagated westward along the equator, leading to a drop in sea surface temperatures by about 0.5 degrees Celsius. These changes were consistent with observations of La Niña conditions during that period.</p><p>The researchers also performed a sensitivity analysis to test how different factors may have affected their results. They found that their conclusions were robust to variations in aerosol size, optical properties, and emission rates. They also found that their results were not sensitive to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations or solar activity.</p><p>However, they acknowledged that their study had some limitations, such as not accounting for other sources of aerosols or natural variability in the climate system. They also cautioned that their findings do not imply a causal relationship between wildfires and La Niña, but rather a possible contribution.</p><p>"Our study does not suggest that wildfires cause La Niña events," said Fasullo. "Rather it shows how wildfires can amplify existing tendencies toward La Niña by altering regional energy balances."</p><h2>The implications for future climate</h2><p>The study by NCAR scientists highlights how human activities can have unintended consequences for the climate system. As global warming increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, more smoke emissions could potentially affect weather patterns and ocean circulation.</p><p>The researchers said that their findings underscore the need for more research on how aerosols from different sources interact with clouds and climate. They also said that their study could help improve climate models and predictions by incorporating more realistic representations of aerosol-cloud interactions.</p><p>One of the challenges in studying aerosol-cloud interactions is the lack of comprehensive and consistent observations of aerosols and clouds across different regions and time scales. Satellite data can provide global coverage, but they have limitations in resolving the vertical structure and microphysical properties of aerosols and clouds. Ground-based and airborne measurements can provide more detailed information, but they are sparse and often limited to specific locations and periods.</p><p>A recent initiative called the Aerosol-Cloud-Meteorology Interactions over the Western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) aims to address this gap by conducting coordinated observations of aerosols, clouds, and meteorology over the western North Atlantic Ocean using NASA aircraft and ships. The experiment, which started in 2020 and will continue until 2023, will collect data on how aerosols from different sources, such as biomass burning, pollution, dust, and sea spray, affect the formation and evolution of low-level marine clouds ( 9 ).</p><p>Another challenge in studying aerosol-cloud interactions is the complexity and diversity of the physical and chemical processes involved. Aerosols can affect clouds in multiple ways, such as changing their number, size, shape, phase, lifetime, precipitation, and radiative properties. These effects depend on various factors, such as the type, concentration, size distribution, and chemical composition of aerosols; the environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind, and turbulence; and the cloud type, such as stratiform or convective, warm or mixed-phase ( 10 ).</p><p>To better understand and quantify these effects, scientists use numerical models that simulate the interactions between aerosols, clouds, and climate at different scales. However, these models have large uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge of the underlying processes and parameters. Moreover, these models often have to make simplifying assumptions or use empirical parameterizations to represent subgrid-scale processes that cannot be resolved explicitly.</p><p>To improve the accuracy and reliability of these models, scientists need to evaluate them against observations and conduct sensitivity experiments to test their responses to different scenarios. They also need to develop new methods and techniques to represent aerosol-cloud interactions more realistically and efficiently. For example, some recent studies have explored the use of machine learning algorithms to improve the parameterization of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models ( 11 ).</p><p>The study by NCAR scientists is an important contribution to advancing our understanding of how wildfires can affect climate through their impact on La Niña. However, more research is needed to fully unravel the complex and nonlinear interactions between aerosols, clouds, and climate in a changing world.</p><h6>Australia bushfires La Niña climate change aerosol-cloud interactions</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
