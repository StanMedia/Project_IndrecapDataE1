His wife Susan Geston suggested that he get checked out, but Bridges was hesitant to go to the doctor's because he wasn't in pain.</p><p>"I'm hiking and feeling great. My shins really itch, and I think, Oh, I just got, you know, dry skin," Bridges recalled. "Then I had night sweats, but thought, That's just hot summer nights. It turns out those are lymphoma symptoms."</p><p>Lymphoma is a cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. It can cause swollen lymph nodes, fever, weight loss, fatigue and other signs. There are two main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin. Bridges did not specify which type he has.</p><p>According to the American Cancer Society, about 89,000 new cases of lymphoma are expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2023, and about 20,000 people are expected to die from it. The survival rates vary depending on the type and stage of lymphoma.</p><h2>How Bridges battled cancer and COVID-19</h2><p>Bridges said he started chemotherapy treatment to shrink his tumor, which was 9 by 12 inches in size. However, he also contracted COVID-19 in January 2021 along with his wife. He said the virus hit him hard because his immune system was weakened by the chemo.</p><p>"Cancer was nothing compared to the COVID," he said. "A lot of getting better was a matter of setting really small goals. At first, they'd say, 'How long can you stand?' For a while, my record was 45 seconds before I'd collapse. And then they were saying: 'Oh, look, you're standing for a minute! That's so cool, now can you walk five feet?'"</p><p>Bridges spent five weeks in the hospital and needed oxygen assistance for months after being discharged. He said he contemplated his own death and accepted that he was old and dying. But he also decided to embrace his situation as a challenge and an opportunity.</p><p>"I asked myself, 'How are you going to go about it?' And I thought, I'm a dancer, man, and I'm a musician. I'm going to jam with this situation, you know?" he said.</p><h2>How Bridges recovered and returned to work</h2><p>Bridges shared some good news with his fans in September 2021: his cancer was in remission and his tumor had shrunk to the size of a marble. He also said he recovered from COVID-19 and no longer needed oxygen support.</p><p>He credited his recovery to his positive attitude, his supportive family and friends, his medical team and his faith. He also thanked his fans for their prayers and well wishes.</p><p>"I'm feeling terrific," he said in an interview with AARP magazine. "I'm so grateful for all these people who have helped me through this."</p><p>Bridges also returned to work on "The Old Man", a series based on a novel by Thomas Perry about a former CIA operative who goes on the run from assassins. He said he was initially unsure if he could ever work again after his health ordeal.</p><p>"I didn't think I'd ever work again, really," he said. "So at first I said, 'Well, we'll see.' But eventually that became, 'Maybe I can.' I have to admit that I was still frightened of going back to work."</p><p>He said he overcame his fear by thinking of his recovery as a gift and by drawing inspiration from his character Dan Chase.</p><p>"For me, in that hospital bed, the obstacle was death. And that was the way. I kept thinking, Here's the problem, you know? Here's the challenge," he said. "I began to think of my recovery as a gift being presented."</p><p>"The Old Man" is streaming on Hulu.</p><h2>What is cancer and how does it develop?</h2><p>Cancer is a general term for a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. The latter process is called metastasis and is a major cause of death from cancer.</p><p>Cancer can be caused by a variety of factors, such as genetic mutations, environmental exposures, infections, lifestyle habits and aging. Some cancers can be prevented by avoiding or reducing exposure to known risk factors, such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution. Some cancers can also be prevented by vaccination against certain viruses that can cause cancer, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV).</p><p>Cancer can be detected by various methods, such as screening tests, imaging tests, biopsy and blood tests. Early detection of cancer can improve the chances of successful treatment and survival. Some common types of cancer screening tests include mammography for breast cancer, Pap smear for cervical cancer, colonoscopy for colorectal cancer and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer.</p><p>Cancer can be treated by various modalities, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy and hormone therapy. The choice of treatment depends on several factors, such as the type, stage and location of cancer, the patient’s age, health and preferences, and the availability and cost of treatment options. Some cancers can be cured if detected early and treated effectively. Some cancers can be controlled for long periods of time with ongoing treatment. Some cancers cannot be cured or controlled and may require palliative care to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.</p><h2>How does cancer affect physical health?</h2><p>Cancer can affect physical health in many ways, depending on the type and stage of cancer, the treatment received and the individual’s response to treatment. Some possible effects of cancer on physical health include:</p><ul><li>Pain: Cancer or its treatment can cause pain in different parts of the body. Pain can be acute or chronic, mild or severe, constant or intermittent. Pain can affect daily activities, sleep quality and mood. Pain can be managed by various methods, such as medication, non-drug therapies (such as massage, acupuncture or relaxation techniques), nerve blocks or surgery.</li><li>Fatigue: Cancer or its treatment can cause fatigue, which is a feeling of extreme tiredness that does not improve with rest. Fatigue can affect physical performance, concentration, memory and mood. Fatigue can be managed by various methods, such as energy conservation strategies (such as prioritizing tasks, delegating responsibilities or taking breaks), exercise (such as walking or stretching), nutrition (such as eating well-balanced meals and drinking enough fluids) and psychological support (such as counseling or support groups).</li><li>Weight loss or gain: Cancer or its treatment can cause weight loss or gain due to various reasons, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</li></ul><h6>Jeff Bridges, lymphoma, COVID-19, recovery, The Old Man</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
