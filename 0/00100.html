The product is sold online by Szabo Inc., a knife retailer, for $85. According to the company's website, the straw "allows the user to drink effortlessly any thick shake or smoothie" but is also "designed for self defense" and is "super tough and long enough to be used like a dagger."</p><p>The straw is prohibited under Massachusetts law, which bans carrying certain "edged instruments" that include stilettos and daggers. TSA spokesman Daniel Velez told CNN that the straw's "strength, length and dagger-like point make it a defense weapon" and that the "company's website labels it as such."</p><h2>How did the TSA agents find the weapon?</h2><p>The incident occurred on April 23 at Boston Logan International Airport, where Arman Achuthan Nair, of Chicago, was headed to board a flight to his hometown. Velez said that Nair had "artfully concealed the vampire straw with other straws" in his backpack, but the TSA agents detected it during the screening process.</p><p>Velez posted a photo of the confiscated item on Twitter and wrote: "These items are not allowed in passenger carry-on bags. A passenger found that out yesterday @BostonLogan when @MassStatePolice confiscated the item and eventually arrested the 26-year-old man on a state charge. #travelfail"</p><p>Massachusetts State Police said in a statement that Nair was detained Sunday evening and charged with carrying a dangerous weapon. He posted bail and was scheduled to appear in court on May 30.</p><h2>What are the consequences of carrying a prohibited item on an airplane?</h2><p>According to the TSA website, passengers who bring prohibited items to the airport may face civil penalties of up to $13,910 per violation per person. The amount of the fine depends on several factors, such as the type of item, whether it was concealed or not, and whether it was intentional or not.</p><p>The TSA also advises passengers to check their bags before traveling and to review the list of prohibited items on its website or mobile app. Some items that are allowed in checked bags may not be allowed in carry-on bags, such as knives, scissors, or tools.</p><p>The TSA also warns travelers that some items may be illegal in certain states or countries, even if they are not prohibited by the TSA. For example, brass knuckles, switchblades, and stun guns are illegal in some states. Travelers should check the local laws before bringing such items with them.</p><h2>How does a vampire straw work as a weapon?</h2><p>A vampire straw can be used as a weapon because of its sharp tip, which can pierce through synthetic materials or human flesh. The straw can also be used to deflate tires by puncturing them. The straw can be held like a dagger and stabbed at an attacker, or thrown like a dart. The straw can also be concealed in a cup or a bag and deployed quickly in case of an emergency.</p><h2>Who invented the vampire straw and why?</h2><p>The vampire straw was invented by Laci Szabo, a former US Marine and law enforcement officer who is also a martial arts expert and a knife designer. Szabo runs his own company, Szabo Inc., which sells knives, swords, axes, and other weapons. According to his website, Szabo has a passion for "creating unique and functional tools for self defense."</p><p>Szabo told CNN that he came up with the idea of the vampire straw after he saw a titanium straw at a restaurant. He said he thought it would be a good idea to make a straw that could also be used as a weapon. He said he named it the vampire straw because it can suck blood out of an attacker.</p><p>Szabo said he sells about 10 to 15 vampire straws per month, mostly to collectors and enthusiasts. He said he does not encourage people to use them for violence, but only for self defense. He said he was surprised to hear about the arrest at the Boston airport and that he did not know the traveler who bought the straw.</p><h6>Boston Logan International Airport, vampire straw, TSA, Massachusetts State Police, titanium straw, self defense</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
