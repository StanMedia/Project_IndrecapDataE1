The exercise was aimed at enhancing the interoperability and readiness of both militaries to respond to various security challenges in the region.</p><p>The joint drills were also a show of force against China, which has been increasing its military presence and activities in the disputed waters, where it claims almost all of the resource-rich area as its sovereign territory. China has built artificial islands, installed military facilities, and deployed coast guard and militia vessels to assert its claims, often harassing and intimidating other claimants such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan.</p><p>The US, which does not take sides in the territorial disputes but considers the South China Sea as part of its vital national interests, has been conducting freedom of navigation operations and surveillance flights to challenge China's excessive maritime claims and uphold international law. The US has also been providing security assistance and capacity-building to its regional allies and partners, especially the Philippines, which has a mutual defense treaty with Washington since 1951.</p><h2>Philippines receives top envoy from China</h2><p>While strengthening its defense ties with the US, the Philippines has also been trying to maintain friendly relations with China, its largest trading partner and a major source of investment and infrastructure funding. The Philippines has been pursuing a dual-track approach of separating its economic cooperation with China from its security cooperation with the US.</p><p>This delicate balancing act was on display this month when the Philippines received a top envoy from China, who sought to ease tensions and promote cooperation between the two neighbors. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Manila on April 16-17 and met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.</p><p>Wang announced that China would donate an additional 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the Philippines, bringing its total donation to one million doses. He also pledged to support the Philippines' economic recovery and development projects under President Marcos' "Build, Build, Build" program. Wang said that China was willing to work with the Philippines to advance their comprehensive strategic cooperation and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability.</p><p>However, Wang also expressed China's concern over the Philippines' defense cooperation with the US, especially over the Taiwan issue. He urged the Philippines to adhere to the one-China principle and not to interfere in China's internal affairs or support Taiwan's independence. He warned that any attempt to undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity would have serious consequences for regional security.</p><p>Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing considers as a breakaway province awaiting reunification by force if necessary, has been facing increasing military pressure from China in recent months. China has been sending warplanes and ships near Taiwan's airspace and waters almost daily, prompting Taiwan to scramble its own forces to intercept them. The US has also increased its support for Taiwan's defense and democracy, angering Beijing.</p><p>The Philippines, like most countries in the world, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan but maintains unofficial ties through economic and cultural exchanges. The Philippines also recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China under the one-China policy. However, some Philippine officials have expressed sympathy and solidarity with Taiwan amid China's threats. For instance, Locsin tweeted in January that he saluted Taiwan's courage and resilience in defending itself against China's aggression.</p><h2>Philippines prepares for summit meeting with US</h2><p>As China tries to drive a wedge between the Philippines and the US over the Taiwan issue, President Marcos is preparing for his first summit meeting with US President Joe Biden in Washington next week. The meeting is expected to reaffirm the strong alliance and friendship between the two countries and discuss ways to enhance their cooperation on various issues of mutual concern.</p><p>President Marcos has been on a charm offensive to mend ties with Manila's historical ally, is set to fly to the United States to meet with President Joe Biden in Washington next week. His visit caps a month of frenetic exchanges with the United States.</p><h2>Philippines prepares for summit meeting with US</h2><p>President Marcos is expected to discuss a range of issues with President Biden, including economic cooperation, clean energy, human rights, and regional security. The two leaders are also likely to reaffirm their commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty, which obliges both countries to come to each other's aid in case of an armed attack.</p><p>The summit meeting comes at a time when the US and the Philippines have been enhancing their defense cooperation amid shared concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. The US has been providing security assistance and capacity-building to the Philippines, which has been upgrading its military capabilities and modernizing its bases.</p><p>In February, the Philippines granted new rights to the US military to add four bases to the five originally covered under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which allows the US to rotate troops and equipment through Philippine facilities. The new facilities include three on the main island of Luzon, where most of the Balikatan exercises took place, and one on Palawan island, which faces the disputed Spratly islands in the South China Sea.</p><p>The US has also been conducting freedom of navigation operations and surveillance flights in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, challenging China's excessive maritime claims and supporting Taiwan's defense and democracy. The US has also increased its arms sales and diplomatic contacts with Taiwan, angering Beijing.</p><p>The Philippines, like most countries in the world, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan but maintains unofficial ties through economic and cultural exchanges. The Philippines also recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China under the one-China policy. However, some Philippine officials have expressed sympathy and solidarity with Taiwan amid China's threats.</p><p>For instance, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. tweeted in January that he saluted Taiwan's courage and resilience in defending itself against China's aggression. He also said that he would not rule out a visit to Taiwan if invited by its government.</p><p>China has warned the Philippines not to interfere in its internal affairs or support Taiwan's independence. China has also objected to the EDCA and the Balikatan exercises, accusing the US and the Philippines of trying to target China and destabilize the region.</p><h2>Philippines faces challenges and opportunities</h2><p>The Philippines faces both challenges and opportunities as it tries to balance its relations with Beijing and Washington amid growing tensions in the region. On one hand, the Philippines needs China's economic assistance and cooperation to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and pursue its development goals. On the other hand, the Philippines needs US security assistance and cooperation to protect its sovereignty and interests in the face of China's assertiveness.</p><p>The Philippines also has to consider its own national interests and public opinion, which may not always align with those of either China or the US. For example, while President Marcos has been seeking good relations with both countries, he has also been vocal about defending Philippine sovereignty and rights in the South China Sea. He has also been supportive of human rights and democracy in Myanmar, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, which may not sit well with Beijing.</p><p>The Philippines also has to deal with its domestic issues, such as poverty, corruption, insurgency, terrorism, natural disasters, and environmental degradation. These issues may affect its ability to pursue its foreign policy objectives and maintain its regional influence.</p><p>The Philippines has a unique role and responsibility as a founding member of ASEAN, a key partner of both China and the US, and a strategic location in the Indo-Pacific region. The Philippines has to leverage its strengths and assets to advance its interests and values while contributing to regional peace and stability.</p><h6>US-Philippines alliance, China-Taiwan tensions, South China Sea disputes</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
