Using 3D computer models, the researchers showed that intermediate-mass black holes, which are estimated to be between three and 10 times the mass of our sun, take a few bites out of wayward stars before tossing away the stellar crumbs and leaving a cosmic trail.</p><p>The researchers made the discovery while running simulations on black holes of various masses and sending sun-size stars past them. They found that when a star approaches an intermediate-mass black hole, the black hole's gravity pulls the star into an elongated shape and snags it in its orbit. Each time the star makes another lap around the black hole, the black hole takes another bite out of it, ripping off some of its mass and causing a flare of light.</p><p>When only the dense, misshapen core of the star is left, the black hole discards it and sends it flying across the galaxy at high speed. The ejected core becomes a runaway star that can be detected by its high velocity and unusual appearance.</p><p>The study, which has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal, was presented on Tuesday at the American Physical Society's April meeting.</p><p>"We obviously cannot observe black holes directly because they don't emit light," said lead study author Fulya Kıroğlu, a doctoral student of astrophysics at Northwestern University's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences in Evanston, Illinois, in a statement. "So, instead, we have to look at the interactions between black holes and their environments. We found that stars undergo multiple passages before being ejected. After each passage, they lose more mass, causing a flair of light as (it's) ripped apart. Each flare is brighter than the last, creating a signature that might help astronomers find them."</p><h2>The elusive black holes</h2><p>Intermediate-mass black holes are still a mystery to astronomers. They are thought to be created when exploding stars collapse, but their existence has not been confirmed yet. They are smaller than supermassive black holes, which are found at the centers of most large galaxies and can be millions to billions of times the mass of our sun. They are also larger than stellar-mass black holes, which are typically up to 100 times the mass of our sun and are formed by the death of massive stars.</p><p>"Their presence is still debated," said Kıroğlu. "Astrophysicists have uncovered evidence that they exist, but that evidence can often be explained by other mechanisms. For example, what appears to be an intermediate-mass black hole might actually be the accumulation of stellar-mass black holes."</p><p>One way to find intermediate-mass black holes is to look for their effects on their surroundings. For instance, in 2019, astronomers reported the detection of a gravitational wave signal that suggested the merger of two intermediate-mass black holes. However, this signal was too weak to be conclusive.</p><p>Another way is to look for their messy eating habits. The researchers hope that their study will provide clues for future observations of intermediate-mass black holes by looking for their distinctive flares and runaway stars.</p><p>"We think this is a unique signature for intermediate-mass black holes," said study co-author Frederic Rasio, a professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University and director of its Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics. "If we see these flares repeatedly from one source over time or if we see many sources with these flares in one galaxy cluster or globular cluster (a dense group of stars), then we can infer that there is an intermediate-mass black hole there."</p><h2>The cosmic context</h2><p>The study also sheds light on how black holes interact with stars and how they affect the evolution of galaxies. Black holes play an important role in shaping the structure and dynamics of galaxies by influencing their star formation and gas distribution.</p><p>By studying how different types of black holes eat stars differently, astronomers can learn more about how they grow and how they affect their environments.</p><p>For example, supermassive black holes tend to swallow stars whole or tear them apart completely, producing bright flashes of light that can be seen across the universe. Stellar-mass black holes tend to interact with stars and other black holes, producing various phenomena such as gravitational waves, gamma-ray bursts, and X-ray flares.</p><p>The study also contributes to the understanding of how black holes form and evolve over time. Intermediate-mass black holes are thought to be the building blocks of supermassive black holes, which are essential for the formation and growth of galaxies. By studying how intermediate-mass black holes eat stars and leave a cosmic trail, astronomers can trace their origin and history.</p><h6>Black holes, stars, intermediate-mass black holes, computer simulations</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
