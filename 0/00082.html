Lion Air Flight 610 crashed October 29, 2018. The crashes killed a combined 346 people.</p><p>The US did not ground the plane until three days after the second crash, after every other country worldwide had. The grounding ultimately lasted nearly two years.</p><h2>FAA's processes were outdated and inconsistent, report says</h2><p>The inspector general report, released Friday, recommended the agency update and improve its policies for evaluating crashes and other events. The FAA told the inspector general it would make updates and develop formal training.</p><p>While awaiting additional data in March 2019, FAA officials issued an official notice backing up their decision to allow the Max to continue flying. An engineer drafted an analysis which showed the risk of fatalities to be 13 times higher than the relevant FAA standard. An FAA official said the analysis "suggested that there was a 25% chance of an accident in 60 days" if no changes were made to the planes.</p><p>"However," the inspector general's report said, "this document was not completed and did not go through managerial review due to lack of detailed flight data".</p><p>The inspector general concluded the FAA's decision-making on the grounding after the second crash "aligned with its typical processes" by waiting for detailed data, but called the processes "outdated" and said officials are not uniformly trained on how to use them.</p><h2>Boeing altered a faulty flight-control system before returning to service</h2><p>The FAA did not let the planes fly again until late 2020, after Boeing altered a flight-control system that autonomously pointed the plane's nose down before both crashes. The inspector general's office said the FAA's caution on grounding the Max fit with its tendency of waiting for detailed data – an explanation that agency officials offered at the time. Still, the watchdog recommended that FAA document how key and urgent safety decisions are made and make several other changes in how it analyzes crashes.</p><p>The FAA said in a response attached to the inspector general's report that it is committed to measures that will improve safety and has started to update procedures based on the Max tragedies. In a statement to CNN, the FAA said it concurs with the inspector general's recommendations and had already identified the issues outlined in the report.</p><p>"Safety advocates and lawmakers have harshly criticized the FAA for its decision to certify the Max – FAA officials did not fully understand the flight-control system implicated in both crashes".</p><h2>Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board</h2><p>Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport in Ethiopia to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. On March 10, 2019, the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft that operated the flight crashed near the town of Bishoftu, six minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard.</p><p>The victims came from 35 countries and included eight crew members and one security official. Among them were 22 United Nations staff members, humanitarian workers, environmental activists, academics, journalists, and tourists. One of them was Antoine Lewis, an Army captain from Matteson who served in Afghanistan.</p><p>The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were recovered from the crash site and analyzed by the French aviation accident investigation agency BEA. The preliminary report, released on April 4, 2019, revealed that the pilots struggled to control the aircraft as it repeatedly nosedived due to a faulty sensor that activated an automated flight-control system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System).</p><p>MCAS was designed to prevent the aircraft from stalling by pushing the nose down if it detected a high angle of attack. However, in both Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610, which crashed in October 2018 under similar circumstances, MCAS received erroneous data from a single angle of attack sensor and repeatedly pushed the nose down despite the pilots' attempts to counteract it.</p><p>The preliminary report also stated that the pilots followed the emergency procedures recommended by Boeing and the FAA, but they were unable to regain control of the aircraft. The report recommended that Boeing review the flight control system of the 737 Max and that aviation authorities verify the changes before allowing the aircraft to resume operations.</p><p>The final report, released on March 9, 2020, confirmed the findings of the preliminary report and added that there were design flaws in the MCAS system, inadequate maintenance of the angle of attack sensor, insufficient pilot training and awareness of the system, and ineffective communication between Boeing and the FAA.</p><p>The report also made several safety recommendations for Boeing, Ethiopian Airlines, the FAA, and other aviation authorities to prevent similar accidents in the future.</p><h6>Boeing 737 Max, FAA, grounding, crashes</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
