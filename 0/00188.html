New study reveals four lifestyle factors that can reduce the risk</h1><p><img src=https://a1.indrecap.com/0/00188.webp height=281 class=antiCLS /></p><p class=imgCredit>Gerd Altmann/Pixabay</p><p>A comprehensive analysis of 323 studies found that four lifestyle factors can significantly lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.</p><h2>What is Alzheimer's disease?</h2><p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for cognitive decline that interferes with daily life. According to the World Health Organization, about 50 million people worldwide have dementia, and Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-70% of cases. The number of people with dementia is expected to rise to 82 million by 2030 and 152 million by 2050.</p><p>The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Some of the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include age, family history, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, smoking, depression, and cognitive inactivity.</p><h2>How to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease?</h2><p>A new study published in the journal Neurology in September 2021 analyzed the results of 323 previous studies that examined the association between various lifestyle factors and the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The researchers used a method called umbrella review, which is a systematic way of summarizing the evidence from multiple meta-analyses (studies that combine the data from several studies).</p><p>The researchers found that four lifestyle factors had a significant protective effect against Alzheimer's disease and dementia:</p><ul><li>Physical activity: Engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week was associated with a 38% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and a 35% lower risk of dementia.</li><li>Cognitive activity: Participating in mentally stimulating activities such as reading, writing, playing games, or learning new skills was associated with a 34% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and a 28% lower risk of dementia.</li><li>Mediterranean diet: Following a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish, olive oil, and low in red meat, dairy products, and sweets was associated with a 33% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and a 21% lower risk of dementia.</li><li>Moderate alcohol consumption: Drinking up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men was associated with a 27% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and a 29% lower risk of dementia.</li></ul><p>The researchers also found that some lifestyle factors had no significant effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, such as smoking cessation, social activity, coffee consumption, vitamin supplementation, and hormone therapy.</p><h2>What are the implications of the study?</h2><p>The study provides strong evidence that adopting a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The researchers estimated that if everyone followed these four lifestyle factors, about 40% of Alzheimer's disease cases and 35% of dementia cases could be prevented worldwide.</p><p>The study also highlights the importance of public health interventions that promote physical activity, cognitive activity, Mediterranean diet, and moderate alcohol consumption among older adults. The researchers suggested that these interventions could be integrated into primary care settings, community programs, or online platforms.</p><p>The study has some limitations, such as the heterogeneity of the included studies, the possibility of residual confounding factors, and the lack of data on the dose-response relationship between lifestyle factors and dementia risk. Therefore, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm and refine the findings.</p><p>However, the study offers hope and guidance for people who want to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. By making simple but effective changes in their daily habits, they can improve their brain health and quality of life.</p><h6>Alzheimer's disease, dementia, lifestyle factors, physical activity, cognitive activity, Mediterranean diet, moderate alcohol consumption</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
