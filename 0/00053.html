Police Scotland said officers were also carrying out searches at a number of addresses as part of the investigation.</p><p>Police Scotland launched a formal investigation into the SNP's finances in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how donations were used. Questions had been raised about funds given to the party for use in a fresh independence referendum campaign.</p><p>Seven people made complaints and a probe was set up following talks with prosecutors.</p><p>The investigation is focused on whether the SNP breached electoral law or committed fraud by diverting donations intended for a second referendum to other purposes, such as paying staff salaries or covering legal fees.</p><p>The SNP has denied any wrongdoing and said it has been cooperating fully with the investigation. The party's governing body has agreed to carry out a review of governance and transparency.</p><h2>The resignation and the reaction</h2><p>Murrell resigned as the SNP's chief executive last month, a post he had held since 1999. He stepped down after Sturgeon's shock resignation as first minister in February.</p><p>Sturgeon, who had led Scotland's devolved government since 2014, announced that she would quit her post on February 15, citing the "brutality" of public life and saying it was time for a change.</p><p>Her announcement sparked a leadership battle within the SNP, which was won by Humza Yousaf, the former health secretary. Yousaf became Scotland's first Muslim and ethnic minority first minister on March 1.</p><p>Sturgeon and Murrell have been married since 2010 and have been key figures in the Scottish independence movement for years. They have both faced criticism and scrutiny over their roles in the party and the government.</p><p>A spokesperson for Sturgeon said she had "no prior knowledge" of Police Scotland's action or intentions. They added: "Ms Sturgeon will fully cooperate with Police Scotland if required, however at this time no such request has been made."</p><p>Yousaf said it was "a difficult day" for the SNP and expressed his support for Murrell and Sturgeon.</p><p>"I obviously can't comment on a live police investigation," Yousaf said. "But what I will say is that the SNP has fully cooperated with the investigation and it will continue to do so."</p><p>He added that Murrell had been "a loyal servant" to the party for more than two decades and that Sturgeon had been "an outstanding leader" for Scotland.</p><p>"I know this will be an incredibly difficult time for them both personally and I send them my best wishes," he said.</p><p>The opposition parties said Murrell's arrest was a serious matter that raised questions about the SNP's integrity and accountability.</p><p>Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said Murrell's arrest was "shocking" and "unprecedented".</p><p>"This is an extremely serious development that goes right to the heart of Nicola Sturgeon's inner circle," Ross said.</p><p>"The public deserve answers about what Nicola Sturgeon knew and when. She cannot hide behind the excuse of an ongoing police investigation."</p><p>Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, said Murrell's arrest was "deeply concerning" and called for transparency from the SNP.</p><p>"This is not about personalities or individuals. This is about public trust in our politics," Sarwar said.</p><p>"The SNP must be open and honest about what has happened here. They cannot sweep this under the carpet or hope it goes away."</p><h2>The implications for the future</h2><p>Murrell's arrest is a major blow to the SNP, which has led Scotland's devolved government since 2007 and has been pushing for a second referendum on independence from the UK.</p><p>The party has seen its popularity decline in recent months amid internal divisions, policy failures and public discontent over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy, health care and education.</p><p>The party also faces growing pressure from the pro-independence movement, which has been frustrated by the lack of progress towards a second referendum.</p><p>The SNP has been campaigning for another vote on Scotland's future since the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, arguing that Scotland should have the right to choose its own destiny.</p><p>Scotland voted to remain in the EU by 62% to 38%, while the UK as a whole voted to leave by 52% to 48%.</p><p>The SNP claims that Brexit has changed the circumstances since the 2014 referendum, when Scotland voted to stay in the UK by 55% to 45%.</p><p>The SNP also says that Scotland has been ignored and sidelined by the UK government during the Brexit negotiations and the Covid-19 pandemic, and that Scotland's interests and values are better served by independence.</p><p>However, the UK government has repeatedly rejected the SNP's calls for a second referendum, saying that the 2014 vote was a "once in a generation" event and that the focus should be on recovering from the pandemic.</p><p>The UK government also says that Scotland benefits from being part of a strong and united UK, which provides economic security, defence and diplomatic clout, and shared social and cultural ties.</p><p>The UK government also argues that leaving the UK would mean leaving the pound, creating a hard border with England, and losing access to UK markets and public services.</p><p>The SNP has proposed holding a second referendum by October 2023, if it can secure a legal agreement with the UK government or win a court challenge.</p><p>The SNP says it will ask voters the same question as in 2014: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"</p><p>However, opinion polls suggest that support for independence is evenly split, with no clear majority either way.</p><p>The latest poll by Ipsos MORI for STV News, conducted in April 2023, found that 49% of Scots would vote yes and 51% would vote no if a referendum was held tomorrow.</p><p>The poll also found that 56% of Scots think there should be another referendum within five years, while 44% think there should not.</p><h6>Scotland, SNP, Peter Murrell</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
