Israel responded with tank and air strikes on targets in the coastal enclave.</p><h2>The escalation</h2><p>The violence erupted on Tuesday after the death of Khader Adnan, a leading figure in the Islamic Jihad group, who had been on hunger strike for nearly three months. He was arrested by Israeli forces in February and held under administrative detention, a controversial measure that allows indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial.</p><p>Adnan, 45, died in a prison clinic after refusing food and medical care. He was accused by Israel of being involved in terrorist activities, but his family and supporters said he was a peaceful activist who protested against Israel's occupation and oppression of the Palestinians.</p><p>His death sparked outrage and grief among Palestinians, who hailed him as a martyr and a hero. Islamic Jihad, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the US and the EU, vowed to avenge his death and said Israel would "pay the price for this crime".</p><p>Shortly after his funeral in his hometown of Arraba in the northern West Bank, militants in Gaza fired rockets towards Israel. The Israeli military said it intercepted most of the rockets with its Iron Dome system, but some landed in open areas or caused damage to buildings. Three foreign workers were injured by shrapnel in one of the rocket attacks.</p><p>Israel retaliated with tank and air strikes on several sites in Gaza, including a military post belonging to Islamic Jihad and a weapons manufacturing facility. The Israeli military said it held Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, responsible for any attack from the territory.</p><p>No casualties were reported on either side of the border as a result of the strikes.</p><h2>The context</h2><p>The latest flare-up of violence comes amid heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians over several issues, including the fate of Jerusalem, the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p><p>Israel and Hamas have fought four wars since 2008, the last one in May 2021, which killed more than 250 people, mostly Palestinians. A fragile ceasefire has been holding since then, but sporadic rocket fire and incendiary balloons from Gaza have continued to test it.</p><p>The situation has also been complicated by the political turmoil in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. Israel has been struggling to form a stable government after four inconclusive elections in two years. The Palestinians have been divided between Hamas in Gaza and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which cancelled its first elections in 15 years in April.</p><p>The death of Adnan has also highlighted the plight of more than 4,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, many of them under administrative detention or without due process. According to human rights groups, at least six other Palestinian prisoners are currently on hunger strike to protest their conditions.</p><p>The UN human rights office has called for an independent investigation into Adnan's death and urged Israel to end its use of administrative detention. It also expressed concern about the escalation of violence and called for restraint from all sides.</p><h2>The hunger striker</h2><p>Khader Adnan was a prominent Palestinian activist and a leader of the Islamic Jihad group, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and many Western countries. He was known for his advocacy for Palestinian prisoners' rights and his use of hunger strikes as a form of protest against Israel's occupation and detention policies.</p><p>Adnan was born in 1978 in Arraba, a town in the northern West Bank. He studied mathematics and Islamic law at Birzeit University and became involved in Islamic Jihad, a militant group that seeks to establish an Islamic state in Palestine and opposes any peace negotiations with Israel.</p><p>Adnan was arrested by Israeli forces 12 times and spent about eight years in Israeli prisons. He staged several hunger strikes during his detentions, demanding an end to his administrative detention, a controversial measure that allows Israel to hold suspects without charge or trial for renewable periods of up to six months.</p><p>His longest hunger strike lasted 66 days in 2012, drawing international attention and solidarity from other Palestinian prisoners and activists. He ended his strike after reaching a deal with Israel to release him without charges. He repeated his hunger strike in 2015 for 55 days, again securing his release.</p><p>His latest hunger strike began on Feb. 5, 2023, shortly after his arrest by Israeli forces near his home. He was accused of being involved in terrorist activities, but his family and supporters said he was a peaceful activist who protested against Israel's oppression of the Palestinians.</p><p>He refused food and medical care for nearly three months, despite his deteriorating health condition. He was held in a prison clinic in Ramla, where he lost consciousness and died on May 2, 2023. He was the first Palestinian hunger striker to die in Israeli custody since 1989.</p><p>His death sparked outrage and grief among Palestinians, who hailed him as a martyr and a hero. His funeral in his hometown was attended by thousands of people, who chanted slogans against Israel and called for revenge.</p><p>His death also triggered a flare-up of violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, who fired rockets at Israel in response to his death. Israel retaliated with tank and air strikes on Gaza, killing one person and injuring several others.</p><p>A ceasefire mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations was reached on May 3, 2023, but the situation remains tense and volatile.</p><h6>Khader Adnan, hunger strike, death, Gaza rockets</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
