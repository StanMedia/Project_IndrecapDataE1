Souvenir shops are full of their faces, newspapers across the world discuss them, and television dramas based on their lives have never been more popular.</p><p>Whenever people are critical of the royal family, the oft-repeated retort is "but think of the tourism!" This has been particularly common rhetoric recently, as many people question how a country facing mass strikes and a crippling cost of living crisis can afford the estimated £100 million ($125 million) cost of King Charles III's coronation.</p><p>In a recent YouGov poll, 51% did not believe the coronation should be paid for by taxpayers. For young people, this figure was even higher, at 62%. But supporters will often use tourism as justification for lavish expenses.</p><p>The royal family does bring tourism to the UK. The economic consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated that the coronation weekend would lead to a £337 million ($422 million) boost from tourism and pub spending.</p><p>But if the royal family were to disappear, would the UK's tourism industry suddenly implode?</p><h2>The historical legacy</h2><p>2011 research by Visit Britain found that around 60% of tourists to the UK are likely to visit places associated with the royal family. While there is no more recent specifically royal data, in 2022 Visit Britain found that history and heritage was the biggest pull factor to tourists.</p><p>And while the international perception of Britain is certainly intertwined with the royal family, this does not tell us whether a reigning royal family is necessary for tourism. After all, the history surrounding the monarchy and places associated with them would still be here even if the royal family was not.</p><p>Ottoman palaces of Istanbul remain wildly popular attractions 100 years since the collapse of the caliphate, as are the royal châteaus of France or imperial palaces of China. Lack of royalty does not seem to have affected these countries' appeal, each of which attract more tourists annually than the UK.</p><h2>The American connection</h2><p>The USA is the UK's largest tourist market, and American tourists do seem to be very fond of things associated with British royalty. But this may change with the new monarch.</p><p>In a poll taken in February 2021, before the death of Queen Elizabeth II, a whopping 68% of Americans viewed her favorably. But only 37% felt the same about Prince Charles. And after his controversial interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, where he admitted to having an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles while still married to Princess Diana, his popularity plummeted even further.</p><p>Some experts have suggested that King Charles III may face a "republican backlash" from Americans who are disillusioned with his image and actions. This could affect their willingness to visit Britain or spend money on royal souvenirs.</p><p>On the other hand, some younger members of the royal family have maintained their popularity among Americans. Prince William and Kate Middleton have been dubbed "the new face of the monarchy" by some media outlets, and their children have captured the hearts of many. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have also gained a loyal fan base in the US, especially after their move to California.</p><p>These royals may still attract tourists who are interested in their lives and activities, even if they are not directly involved in the coronation or state affairs.</p><h2>The future prospects</h2><p>The coronation of King Charles III will undoubtedly be a major event for British tourism, as millions of people will flock to London to witness history being made. But whether this will translate into long-term benefits for the industry remains uncertain.</p><p>The royal family may still be a significant factor in attracting tourists to Britain, but they are not the only one. The UK has many other attractions and advantages that appeal to visitors, such as its cultural diversity, natural beauty, artistic heritage, and sporting events.</p><p>The tourism industry may also need to adapt to changing preferences and expectations among travelers, who may seek more authentic and sustainable experiences rather than traditional ones. The royal family may have to do the same, by becoming more transparent and accountable to the public they serve.</p><p>The relationship between the royal family and British tourism is complicated and evolving. It is not a simple case of "no monarchy, no tourists". But it is also not a guarantee that having a king or queen will always boost the industry. The royal family may have to work harder to maintain their relevance and appeal in a changing world, and to justify their costs and privileges. The tourism industry may have to diversify and innovate to offer more value and variety to visitors. And the public may have to decide what role they want the monarchy to play in their society and culture.</p><h2>The declining interest</h2><p>The British royal family may have enjoyed a long reign of popularity and prestige, but recent polls suggest that their appeal is waning among younger generations.</p><p>According to a YouGov survey conducted in May 2021, 41% of 18-24 year olds now say Britain should have an elected head of state, while only 31% would like to see the monarchy continue. This is a reversal of sentiment from two years ago, when 46% preferred the monarchy to 26% who wanted it replaced.</p><p>The same survey found that support for the monarchy was also declining among 25-49 year olds, while it remained high among those aged over 65. Overall, 61% of Britons still favoured the monarchy, while 24% thought it should be replaced with an elected figure.</p><p>But why are young people turning their backs on the monarchy? What factors have contributed to this change of attitude?</p><h2>The possible reasons</h2><p>There may be several reasons why young people are less interested in the royal family than their elders. Some of these may include:</p><ul><li><p>The generational gap: Young people may feel less connected to the monarchy, which represents a traditional and hierarchical institution that does not reflect their values or aspirations. They may also have less respect for the authority and legitimacy of the crown, which derives from an ancient and hereditary system that they may perceive as unfair and outdated.</p></li><li><p>The political context: Young people may be more critical of the monarchy in light of the social and economic challenges they face, such as rising inequality, unemployment, climate change, and Brexit. They may question the relevance and cost of maintaining a royal family that enjoys privileges and benefits that they do not. They may also resent the influence and interference of the monarchy in political affairs, especially after the controversial prorogation of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2019.</p></li><li><p>The media exposure: Young people may be more exposed to negative and scandalous stories about the royal family, which may tarnish their image and reputation. They may also be more influenced by alternative sources of information and entertainment, such as social media, podcasts, and streaming services, which offer a more diverse and critical perspective on the monarchy. They may also be less interested in the pomp and ceremony of royal events, which may seem boring and outdated to them.</p></li><li><p>The personal preferences: Young people may have different opinions and preferences about individual members of the royal family, which may affect their overall attitude towards the monarchy. They may be more supportive of younger and more progressive royals, such as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who have broken away from the traditional norms and expectations of royal life. They may also be less enthusiastic about older and more conservative royals, such as Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, who have been involved in controversies and scandals in the past.</p></li></ul><h2>The future implications</h2><p>The declining interest in the monarchy among young people may have significant implications for the future of the institution and the country. Some of these may include:</p><ul><li><p>The succession crisis: The death or abdication of Queen Elizabeth II, who has been widely respected and admired by most Britons, may trigger a crisis of legitimacy and popularity for her successor, Prince Charles. He may face a lack of support and enthusiasm from young people, who may prefer his son Prince William or his grandson Prince George to take over. He may also face a challenge from republicans and nationalists, who may seize the opportunity to call for a referendum on the monarchy or independence from the UK.</p></li><li><p>The constitutional reform: The changing attitudes towards the monarchy among young people may prompt a demand for constitutional reform that would limit or abolish the powers and privileges of the royal family. This may include reducing their public funding, removing their role in appointing or dismissing governments, ending their exemption from taxes and laws, or abolishing their titles and honors. Such reforms may require a public consultation or a referendum that would involve all citizens.</p></li><li><p>The cultural shift: The loss of interest in the monarchy among young people may reflect a broader cultural shift that would affect the identity and values of Britain. The monarchy has been a symbol of national unity and continuity for centuries, but it may become less relevant and representative for a diverse and dynamic society that seeks more democracy and equality. The monarchy may also lose its influence and appeal abroad, where it has been a source of soft power and prestige for Britain.</p></li></ul><h6>Royal family, Tourism, Monarchy, Republic, Public opinion, Young People</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
