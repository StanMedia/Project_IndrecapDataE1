The delay lowered climbers' depleted oxygen levels, leading to sickness and exhaustion. At least four of 11 deaths that year were blamed on overcrowding.</p><p>A picture taken by climber Nirmal Purja showing a dense trail of climbers huddling on an exposed ridge to mountain's summit in May 2019 went viral. He told CNN at the time that there were roughly 320 people in the queue to the top in an area known as the "death zone".</p><p>The highest number of climbers receiving permits this season were from China (96), followed by the United States (87).</p><p>Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told AFP that the high numbers this season were the result of many climbers being unable to travel to Nepal in recent years due to the pandemic.</p><p>In addition, new rules on the Chinese side of Everest requiring climbers to have scaled one other 8,000-metre peak first were sending more Chinese to Nepal.</p><p>Nepal is home to eight of the 10 highest mountains in the world, so mountaineering is a significant source of revenue, employing large teams of people to support climbers.</p><h2>Nepal tries to manage safety and environmental issues</h2><p>To avoid overcrowding, Nepali authorities say they are setting up more than one rope wherever possible.</p><p>"The geography we can't change... but we are trying to manage by adding multiple ropes," Yubaraj Khatiwada, the director of Nepal's Tourism Department, told CNN.</p><p>Three Sherpas died earlier this month after being buried by a block of snow on Everest, according to Khatiwada. They were delivering materials to construct and clear a route to be used by climbers to get to the top of the mountain.</p><p>Ang Tshering Sherpa said recent snowfall has heightened the risk of avalanches on the mountain.</p><p>"Normally, it's during the winter when there should have been a snowfall, but there was snowfall recently during the spring," Sherpa said. "The fresh snow remains soft, which increases the risk of avalanche".</p><p>Three Nepali climbers went missing on Everest while crossing the treacherous Khumbu Icefall on April 12. Authorities called off the rescue after concluding that it was not possible to retrieve their bodies from a deep crevasse.</p><p>Nepal has also been trying to address environmental issues caused by mountaineering activities on Everest. In 2019, a team of volunteers collected more than 10 tonnes of trash from Everest during a two-month clean-up campaign. The waste included plastic bottles, cans, oxygen cylinders, tents, batteries and human faeces.</p><p>In 2020, Nepal imposed a ban on single-use plastics in Everest region in an effort to reduce pollution and protect its fragile ecosystem. The ban covers all plastic items less than 30 microns in thickness as well as plastic bags, straws and cutlery. Violators face fines or imprisonment.</p><h2>Mount Everest: a brief history and some facts</h2><p>Mount Everest is the highest point on Earth, with an official elevation of 8,849 meters (29,032 feet) above sea level. However, its height is not fixed, as it rises about 40 centimeters (16 inches) per century due to the movement of tectonic plates.</p><p>The mountain was named after George Everest, a former Surveyor General of India, in 1865. However, it has other local names, such as Chomolungma in Tibetan, meaning "Mother Goddess of the World", and Sagarmatha in Nepali, meaning "Peak of Heaven".</p><p>The first recorded attempt to climb Everest was made by a British expedition in 1921. The first successful ascent was achieved by Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay from Nepal in 1953.</p><p>Since then, more than 9,000 people have reached the summit of Everest, some more than once. The youngest person to climb Everest was 13-year-old Jordan Romero from the United States in 2010. The oldest person was 80-year-old Yuichiro Miura from Japan in 2013.</p><p>The first solo ascent of Everest was made by Reinhold Messner from Italy in 1978. He also became the first person to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen in the same year. The first woman to climb Everest was Junko Tabei from Japan in 1975.</p><p>The Sherpa people are an ethnic group native to the Himalayan region who have a long history of mountaineering. They are often hired as guides and porters by foreign climbers. They are also renowned for their endurance and adaptation to high altitudes.</p><p>The Sherpa hold a record for the most ascents of Everest by a single person. The record holder is Kami Rita Sherpa, who has climbed Everest 25 times as of 2021.</p><p>Mount Everest is not only a challenge for climbers, but also a source of inspiration and reverence for many people. It is considered a sacred place by some religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism. It is also a symbol of human achievement and exploration.</p><p>However, Mount Everest also faces many threats and challenges, such as climate change, pollution, overcrowding, and commercialization. These issues have raised questions about the future of the mountain and its role in the world.</p><h6>Mount Everest, Nepal, Tibet, China, climbing, permits</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
