Located off the coast of Noli, Italy, southwest of Genoa, the farm consists of an array of suspended, transparent, dome-shaped greenhouses called biospheres, anchored to the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>The project was started in 2012 by Luca Gamberini and his father Sergio, who run a diving equipment company called Ocean Reef Group. They were inspired by the idea of creating an alternative way of growing food that would not depend on land, water, or weather conditions.</p><p>"The mission of this technology is to change agriculture, to give it an added possibility for growing produce on the huge amount of coastlines of the Earth, while being sustainable and not affecting the environment," Luca Gamberini tells CNN.</p><h2>The Benefits and Challenges of Growing Crops Underwater</h2><p>The biospheres have several advantages over conventional farming methods. They are constantly irrigated by seawater that evaporates inside the domes and condenses on the walls. They are protected from pests, diseases, and extreme weather events. They also benefit from a stable temperature and a high level of carbon dioxide that enhances photosynthesis.</p><p>The biospheres can hold anywhere from 70 to 100 plants each, ranging from herbs and vegetables to fruits and flowers. Some of the crops grown include basil, lettuce, strawberries, beans, and roses. One study showed that basil grown underwater in Nemo's Garden had a higher level of antioxidants and essential oils than its land-based counterpart.</p><p>However, growing crops underwater also poses some challenges. The biospheres have to withstand the pressure and currents of the ocean. The plants have to adapt to the different light spectrum and salinity levels. The team also has to monitor and adjust the settings of the biospheres remotely through hi-tech sensors and cameras.</p><p>The harvesting process also requires some skill and care. A diver has to clip the vegetation, place it in bags, and float the bags to the surface without damaging the plants or disrupting the biosphere's equilibrium.</p><h2>The Future of Underwater Farming</h2><p>Nemo's Garden is currently a research project that aims to test the feasibility and scalability of underwater farming. The team has obtained a special permit from the Italian government to operate the farm for six months a year, from May to October. They also collaborate with local universities and institutions to conduct scientific experiments and collect data.</p><p>The team hopes that their project will inspire other coastal regions that could benefit from the additional growing space and resources offered by the ocean. They also envision that underwater farming could be integrated with other marine activities such as aquaculture, tourism, and conservation.</p><p>"We believe that this technology can be applied anywhere there is water," Gamberini says. "We hope that one day this will become a common way of producing food for humanity."</p><h6>Nemo's Garden, underwater farming, sustainable agriculture, biosphere</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
