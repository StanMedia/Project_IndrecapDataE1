The T cells are collected from the patient's blood and sent to a laboratory, where they are genetically engineered to produce special receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These receptors enable the T cells to recognize and attack specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells. The modified T cells are then infused back into the patient's bloodstream, where they multiply and seek out and destroy the cancer cells.</p><p>CAR-T therapy has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for some types of blood cancers, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It has also been used in clinical trials for other cancers, such as multiple myeloma and solid tumors. CAR-T therapy has been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer treatment, as it can achieve durable remissions or even cures for some patients who have exhausted all other options.</p><h2>How effective is CAR-T therapy?</h2><p>According to a report by CommonHealth, a Taiwanese health media platform, CAR-T therapy has shown remarkable results in some cases. For example, a 70-year-old man with DLBCL who had failed six rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants was treated with CAR-T therapy at the National Taiwan University Hospital in 2019. He achieved complete remission within two months and has remained cancer-free for more than two years.</p><p>Another example is a 19-year-old girl with ALL who had relapsed four times after chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. She received CAR-T therapy at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in 2020 and also achieved complete remission within two months. She is now preparing for college entrance exams.</p><p>However, CAR-T therapy is not a magic bullet for everyone. Some patients do not respond to the treatment or relapse after a period of time. Some patients also experience severe side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a potentially life-threatening inflammatory reaction caused by the rapid activation of the modified T cells. CRS can cause fever, low blood pressure, organ failure and neurological problems. Another possible complication is neurotoxicity, which can cause confusion, seizures, coma and death.</p><h2>How expensive is CAR-T therapy?</h2><p>One of the biggest challenges of CAR-T therapy is its high cost. According to CommonHealth, the average cost of CAR-T therapy in Taiwan is about NT$10 million (US$357,000), which includes the fees for collecting and modifying the T cells, infusing them back into the patient, hospitalization and supportive care. The cost may vary depending on the type and stage of cancer, the number of T cells needed and the occurrence of complications.</p><p>In comparison, the average cost of chemotherapy for blood cancers in Taiwan is about NT$1 million (US$35,700), while the average cost of a stem cell transplant is about NT$3 million (US$107,100). In other words, CAR-T therapy is about 10 times more expensive than chemotherapy and about three times more expensive than a stem cell transplant.</p><p>In the US, the cost of CAR-T therapy is even higher. According to a report by Kaiser Health News, the list prices for two FDA-approved CAR-T therapies are US$373,000 and US$475,000 respectively. However, these prices do not include the additional costs of hospitalization, supportive care and follow-up care, which can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars more.</p><h2>Who can afford CAR-T therapy?</h2><p>Given its high cost, CAR-T therapy is not accessible to everyone who needs it. In Taiwan, CAR-T therapy is not covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI), which means that patients have to pay out-of-pocket or rely on donations or charity funds. According to CommonHealth, only about 30 patients have received CAR-T therapy in Taiwan so far.</p><p>In contrast, in the US, most patients who receive CAR-T therapy are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, which are government-funded health insurance programs for seniors and low-income people. However, these programs do not cover all the costs of CAR-T therapy and may impose certain restrictions or requirements on eligibility and reimbursement. For example, Medicare only covers CAR-T therapy if it is administered in a hospital that participates in a special registry or clinical study. Moreover, some patients may still face high deductibles, copayments or coinsurance, depending on their specific plans and circumstances.</p><p>In addition, some private health insurance companies may also cover CAR-T therapy, but they may also have their own criteria and limitations. For instance, some insurers may only cover CAR-T therapy for certain types of cancers or only after the patient has tried other treatments first. Some insurers may also require prior authorization or approval before covering CAR-T therapy.</p><h2>What are the ethical and social implications of CAR-T therapy?</h2><p>The high cost of CAR-T therapy raises several ethical and social questions. For example, is it fair that only some patients can access this potentially lifesaving treatment while others cannot? How can the health care system balance the needs and rights of individual patients with the limited resources and public interests of society? How can the health care system ensure that CAR-T therapy is safe, effective and affordable for everyone who needs it?</p><p>One possible solution is to lower the cost of CAR-T therapy by reducing the production costs, increasing the competition among manufacturers, negotiating lower prices with suppliers or subsidizing the patients. Another possible solution is to expand the coverage of CAR-T therapy by increasing the funding, improving the reimbursement policies or relaxing the regulations of health insurance programs. However, these solutions may also have their own challenges and trade-offs, such as compromising the quality, safety or innovation of CAR-T therapy, increasing the financial burden or risk for health care providers or insurers, or creating new inequalities or injustices among different groups of patients or society.</p><p>Therefore, there is no easy answer to the ethical and social dilemmas of CAR-T therapy. It requires a careful and comprehensive evaluation of the benefits and harms, costs and benefits, and rights and responsibilities of all the stakeholders involved, such as patients, families, doctors, nurses, researchers, manufacturers, suppliers, insurers, regulators and policymakers. It also requires a transparent and participatory process of decision-making that respects the values, preferences and interests of all the parties concerned. Ultimately, it requires a collective and collaborative effort to ensure that CAR-T therapy is not only a scientific breakthrough but also a social good.</p><h6>CAR-T therapy, cancer treatment, immunotherapy, cost-effectiveness, ethical issues</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
