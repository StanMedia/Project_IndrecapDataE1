Twenty-nine others were injured and taken to four different hospitals for treatment.</p><p>The fire at the facility, which is run by the National Migration Institute (INM), started shortly after 10 p.m. inside an accommodation area, according to the agency. Authorities said it broke out after they picked up and detained a group of migrants from the streets of the border city, which sits across from El Paso, Texas.</p><p>Sixty-eight men from Central and South America were being held at the facility at the time of the fire, the INM said in a statement. At least 28 Guatemalan nationals were among the dead, Guatemala's Institute of Migration confirmed. One man was Colombian, one was Ecuadorian, 12 were Salvadorans, 13 were Honduran and 13 were Venezuelan, the INM said. It is unclear how many people of each nationality were killed or injured.</p><p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said migrants had set mattresses ablaze in protest against their imminent deportation. "It was related to a protest they started, we think, when they learned that they'd be deported," the president said. "They didn't think that would cause this terrible tragedy," he added.</p><p>Photos from the scene show body bags lined up on the pavement outside. A statement from US Customs and Border Protection said they were "prepared to receive and process those who were injured in the fire and are being transported via ambulance from Mexican to US medical facilities for treatment".</p><h2>Why did it happen?</h2><p>The deadly blaze has underlined the urgent situation in Mexican cities along the border, which have been inundated with migrants sent back from the US by a pandemic-era public health restriction that is set to expire in early May.</p><p>The restriction, known as Title 42, allows US border officials to deny individuals entry to the US "to prevent the spread of communicable disease". It was first implemented at the start of the Covid pandemic and has been extended several times by both former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden.</p><p>Many migrants have been heading to the US border in expectation of an end to Title 42, hoping for a more humane and welcoming approach from the Biden administration. However, they have faced overcrowded shelters, long waits for asylum processing and harsh conditions in detention centers.</p><p>The facility where the fire happened is located near the Stanton-Lerdo Bridge, which links Mexico and the US. Local media say the migrants inside the building where the blaze happened had been picked up by the authorities on Monday and taken to the center.</p><h2>What are the reactions?</h2><p>The fire has sparked outrage and grief among human rights groups, international organizations and governments.</p><p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for a "thorough investigation" into the incident. A spokesman said Mr Guterres would "continue working with the authorities of countries where mixed movements of people occur to establish safer, more regulated, and organised migration pathways".</p><p>The US ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, said the tragedy was "a reminder to the governments of the region of the importance of fixing a broken migration system and the risks of irregular migration".</p><p>Guatemala's Foreign Minister Mario Bucaro expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and said his government would provide assistance to repatriate their remains. He also urged Mexico to guarantee respect for human rights and dignity of migrants.</p><p>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) condemned what it called a "massacre" and urged Mexico to investigate and punish those responsible. It also called for measures to protect migrants' lives and rights.</p><p>Amnesty International said it was "deeply concerned" about reports that migrants were locked up inside without access to fire exits or extinguishers. It demanded an independent probe into possible negligence or abuse by authorities.</p><h2>What are the implications?</h2><p>The fire has raised questions about Mexico's capacity and willingness to handle the influx of migrants along its northern border, as well as its compliance with international standards on migrant detention.</p><p>According to Human Rights Watch, Mexico detained more than 150,000 migrants in 2020, despite recommendations from health authorities to reduce overcrowding and prevent Covid-19 outbreaks. The group also said that Mexico routinely violates the rights of migrants in detention, such as access to legal counsel, information, health care and communication.</p><p>The fire has also put pressure on the US to reconsider its use of Title 42, which has been criticized by human rights groups and lawmakers as a violation of international and domestic law. According to US government data, more than 750,000 migrants have been expelled under Title 42 since March 2020.</p><p>While the Biden administration has exempted unaccompanied children from the policy, it has continued to apply it to most single adults and some families. The administration has said it is working to rebuild a "fair, orderly and humane" immigration system, but has also warned migrants not to come to the US border at this time.</p><p>However, many migrants fleeing violence, poverty and persecution in their home countries are desperate for a chance to seek asylum in the US. Some have resorted to crossing the border illegally or hiring smugglers, exposing themselves to greater dangers and exploitation.</p><p>The fire at the migrant center in Ciudad Juarez has exposed the human cost of a dysfunctional and inhumane migration system that needs urgent reform and cooperation from all parties involved.</p><h6>Mexico, US, migrants, fire, detention center</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
