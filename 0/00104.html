By analyzing the chemical composition of the tusk's growth layers, they detected traces of testosterone surges that indicate the mammoth experienced musth, a period of heightened aggression and sexual activity.</p><p>Musth is a phenomenon observed in male elephants, the living relatives of woolly mammoths. During musth, which usually occurs during the mating season, male elephants experience a dramatic increase in testosterone levels that makes them more aggressive and unpredictable. They also secrete a fluid from their temporal glands and emit a low-frequency rumble to attract females.</p><p>The researchers say this is the first direct evidence that woolly mammoths also experienced musth, which has been inferred from indirect clues such as skeletal injuries and broken tusk tips. The findings shed new light on the social and reproductive behavior of these extinct animals, which roamed the northern hemisphere during the Ice Age.</p><p>The study, published in the journal Nature on May 3, 2023, was led by Michael Cherney, a research affiliate at the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology and a research fellow at the U-M Medical School. He collaborated with colleagues from U-M and other institutions in the U.S., Canada, Russia, and France.</p><h2>The methods</h2><p>The researchers used a novel technique to measure steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol in dentin, the mineralized tissue that makes up the interior portion of all teeth. Tusks are elongated upper incisor teeth that grow continuously throughout an animal's life.</p><p>The researchers analyzed three tusks: one from a male woolly mammoth that lived more than 33,000 years ago in Siberia; one from a female woolly mammoth that lived about 5,600 years ago on Wrangel Island, the last refuge of the species; and one from an African bull elephant that was killed by a hunter in Botswana in 1963.</p><p>They collected powder samples from the internal surfaces of the tusks at half-millimeter increments, corresponding to about two weeks of growth. They then used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of steroid hormones in each sample.</p><h2>The results</h2><p>The researchers found that the male woolly mammoth tusk showed annually recurring testosterone surges up to 10 times higher than baseline levels. These surges were consistent with musth-related testosterone peaks observed in the African bull elephant tusk. The female woolly mammoth tusk did not show any significant variation in hormone levels.</p><p>The researchers also found that the male woolly mammoth tusk showed elevated cortisol levels during some periods of high testosterone, suggesting that the animal experienced stress during musth. Cortisol is a hormone that regulates the body's response to stress.</p><p>The researchers estimated that the male woolly mammoth experienced musth for about two months each year, based on the duration of the testosterone surges. They also estimated that he lived for about 55 years, based on the number of growth layers in his tusk.</p><h2>The implications</h2><p>The study demonstrates that dentin is a useful repository for some hormones and opens up new possibilities for paleoendocrinology, the study of ancient hormones and their effects on physiology and behavior.</p><p>The study also provides new insights into the social and reproductive behavior of woolly mammoths, which are poorly understood due to the scarcity of fossil evidence. The study suggests that woolly mammoths had similar mating strategies as modern elephants, which involve male-male competition and female choice.</p><p>The study also raises some questions about how woolly mammoths adapted to their harsh environment during the Ice Age. The researchers speculate that musth may have helped them survive by increasing their metabolism and body temperature during winter. However, musth may have also increased their vulnerability to predators and environmental stressors.</p><p>The study also highlights the importance of preserving permafrost-preserved specimens such as woolly mammoth tusks, which contain valuable information about past life on Earth.</p><h6>Woolly mammoth, tusk, testosterone, musth</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
