The movement demanded democratic reforms, constitutional amendments and limits to the powers of the monarchy, which is revered as sacred and untouchable in the country.</p><p>The party is led by Pita Limjaroenrat, a 42-year-old entrepreneur and former leader of Future Forward Party, which was dissolved by the Constitutional Court in 2020 for violating election laws. Move Forward inherited most of Future Forward's members and supporters, as well as its vision of transforming Thailand into a more modern, inclusive and egalitarian society.</p><p>Move Forward is campaigning on a radical platform that includes abolishing conscription, reducing military spending, decentralizing power, promoting human rights and social justice, and reforming the monarchy to make it more accountable and transparent.</p><p>The party is appealing to not only young voters, who make up about 30% of the electorate, but also to urban middle-class professionals, academics, activists and others who are dissatisfied with the status quo. According to two opinion polls issued last week, Pita is the favorite candidate for prime minister, ahead of his rivals from other parties.</p><h2>The challenge of Pheu Thai Party</h2><p>Pheu Thai Party is the main opposition party and the biggest rival of Move Forward. It is a populist party that has strong support from rural and urban poor voters, especially in the north and northeast regions of Thailand.</p><p>Pheu Thai is aligned with Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister who was ousted by a military coup in 2006 and lives in exile to avoid corruption charges. Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was also prime minister until another coup in 2014 removed her from power and forced her to flee the country.</p><p>Pheu Thai has won every election since 2001, but its governments have been repeatedly disrupted by coups, court rulings and street protests by royalist and anti-Thaksin groups. The party is seen as a threat by the conservative establishment, which accuses it of being corrupt, divisive and disloyal to the monarchy.</p><p>Pheu Thai is aiming for a landslide victory in this election. It has three prime ministerial candidates, one of whom is Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 36-year-old daughter of Thaksin. The party is also seeking to form a coalition with other democratic parties to oust the pro-military government.</p><h2>The role of Palang Pracharath Party</h2><p>Palang Pracharath Party is the ruling party and the main ally of the military. It was formed in 2018 by former members of the junta that seized power in 2014 and staged a controversial election in 2019 that returned them to power as civilians.</p><p>The party is led by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, a former army chief who led the 2014 coup and has been accused of suppressing dissent, mismanaging the economy and mishandling the Covid-19 pandemic. Prayut is seeking another term as prime minister, despite facing widespread criticism and protests.</p><p>Palang Pracharath is supported by royalists, conservatives, nationalists and some business groups who see it as a guarantor of stability and order. The party is also backed by the Senate, which was appointed by the junta and has a decisive role in choosing the prime minister.</p><p>Palang Pracharath is expected to lose seats in this election, but it may still be able to form a coalition with smaller parties that share its pro-military stance. The party is also hoping to benefit from its recent vaccination campaign and economic stimulus measures.</p><h2>The significance of this election</h2><p>This election is widely seen as a historic moment for Thailand's democracy and future. It is the first since the youth-led movement that challenged the military and monarchy in unprecedented ways. It is also only the second since the last coup that ended a decade of political turmoil.</p><p>The election will test whether the young generation can translate their street activism into electoral power and whether they can overcome the obstacles posed by the military-backed constitution and electoral system. It will also reveal whether the old generation can adapt to the changing demands and expectations of society.</p><p>The election will also have implications for Thailand's relations with its neighbors and allies, especially the United States and China, which have competing interests and influence in the region. It will also affect Thailand's role in regional organizations such as ASEAN and the Quad.</p><p>The election results are expected to be announced on May 15, but the formation of a new government may take longer due to possible negotiations, disputes and legal challenges. The outcome may also trigger new protests or violence if any of the parties or their supporters feel cheated or dissatisfied.</p><h6>Thailand, Election, Democracy, Military, Monarchy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
