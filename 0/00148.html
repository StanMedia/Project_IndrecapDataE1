He initially claimed that he dropped her off at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her. However, he later gave conflicting and contradictory statements to the police and the media, implicating himself and others in her death and disposal.</p><p>Holloway's body was never found, and no charges were filed in the case. A judge later declared Holloway dead in absentia. Her disappearance resulted in a media sensation in the United States and a diplomatic dispute between Aruba and the US over the handling of the investigation.</p><h2>What is he accused of in the US?</h2><p>In 2010, Van der Sloot was indicted by a federal grand jury in Alabama on charges of wire fraud and extortion. He allegedly tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway, in exchange for information about the location of her daughter's remains. He also allegedly received $25,000 as a partial payment from an undercover agent posing as a representative of Holloway's family.</p><p>However, before he could be arrested by the US authorities, Van der Sloot fled to Peru, where he killed another young woman, Stephany Flores, on May 30, 2010 - exactly five years after Holloway's disappearance. He confessed to beating and strangling Flores in his hotel room after she discovered his involvement in the Holloway case on his laptop. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison for Flores' murder in 2012.</p><h2>When will he be extradited?</h2><p>According to a treaty between the US and Peru, Van der Sloot is eligible for extradition after serving at least half of his sentence in Peru. He is expected to complete his sentence by June 2024. However, he could be released earlier if he qualifies for parole or benefits from prison reforms.</p><p>The US Department of Justice confirmed that it is still seeking Van der Sloot's extradition to face the charges in Alabama. A spokesperson said that the department "remains fully committed to ensuring justice for Natalee Holloway and her family."</p><p>Van der Sloot's lawyer, Maximo Altez, said that his client is willing to cooperate with the US authorities and provide information about Holloway's fate. He also said that Van der Sloot hopes to reach a plea deal that would reduce his sentence in exchange for his testimony.</p><h2>What do Holloway's family and friends say?</h2><p>Holloway's family and friends have expressed mixed feelings about Van der Sloot's extradition. Some hope that it will bring closure and justice to their long ordeal, while others doubt that he will ever tell the truth or face any consequences for his actions.</p><p>Holloway's mother said that she is not interested in Van der Sloot's offer to reveal what happened to her daughter. She said that she has already accepted that her daughter is gone and that she does not trust Van der Sloot's words. She also said that she does not want him to profit from her daughter's tragedy.</p><p>Holloway's father, Dave Holloway, said that he is still hopeful that Van der Sloot will be held accountable for his crimes. He said that he believes that Van der Sloot knows more than he has admitted and that he hopes that he will finally confess under pressure from the US justice system.</p><p>Holloway's friends, who were with her on the trip to Aruba, said that they are glad that Van der Sloot will face trial in the US. They said that they have not forgotten their friend and that they want him to pay for what he did to her and Flores.</p><h2>Who is Joran van der Sloot, and what happened?</h2><p>Joran van der Sloot is a 35-year-old Dutch national who has been linked to the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, an 18-year-old from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who vanished on the night of May 30, 2005, while celebrating her high school graduation with classmates on the Dutch Caribbean Island of Aruba.</p><p>Van der Sloot was seen leaving a nightclub with Holloway and his two friends, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. He initially claimed that he dropped her off at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her. However, he later gave conflicting and contradictory statements to the police and the media, implicating himself and others in her death and disposal.</p><p>Holloway's body was never found, and no charges were filed in the case. A judge later declared Holloway dead in absentia. Her disappearance resulted in a media sensation in the United States and a diplomatic dispute between Aruba and the US over the handling of the investigation.</p><p><strong>More details:</strong></p><p>Holloway was one of 124 students who traveled to Aruba for a five-day trip organized by a travel agency. She was last seen by her friends around 1:30 a.m. on May 30, when she left Carlos'n Charlie's, a popular bar and restaurant in downtown Oranjestad, with Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers. She was wearing a blue denim miniskirt and a multi-colored halter top.</p><p>Van der Sloot was a student at the International School of Aruba and lived with his parents in Noord, a town near the Holiday Inn where Holloway and her classmates were staying. He was known as a frequent gambler at the hotel casino and a smooth talker with girls. He met Holloway earlier that day at the casino and flirted with her throughout the night.</p><p>The Kalpoe brothers were friends of Van der Sloot who worked at an Internet café. They drove Van der Sloot and Holloway in their silver Honda Civic to various locations on the island, including a lighthouse and a beach. They later told the police that they dropped off Van der Sloot and Holloway at the Holiday Inn around 2:00 a.m. and saw her being approached by a security guard.</p><p>However, surveillance cameras at the hotel did not show any sign of Holloway or Van der Sloot arriving or leaving that night. The security guard they mentioned was also cleared by the police after providing an alibi. Van der Sloot changed his story several times over the years, sometimes admitting that he lied to protect himself or his friends, sometimes accusing others of harming Holloway, sometimes claiming that she died accidentally or of natural causes, and sometimes offering to reveal her location for money or favors.</p><p>None of his statements were ever verified by physical evidence or corroborated by witnesses. He also contradicted himself on crucial details, such as whether he had sex with Holloway, whether he used drugs or alcohol that night, whether he called anyone for help after she allegedly died, and whether he buried her or dumped her in the ocean.</p><p>The police arrested Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers multiple times between June 2005 and November 2007 on suspicion of involvement in Holloway's disappearance, but they were released each time due to lack of evidence or legal grounds. They also searched their homes, vehicles, computers, phones, and other belongings for clues, but found nothing conclusive.</p><p>The investigation also involved hundreds of volunteers, local authorities, Dutch marines, FBI agents, private investigators, forensic experts, divers, dogs, helicopters, planes, boats, submarines, satellites, and even psychics. They scoured every inch of the island and its surrounding waters for any trace of Holloway or her belongings, but came up empty-handed.</p><p>The case attracted intense media attention in the US and abroad, especially after Holloway's mother arrived in Aruba and publicly criticized the authorities for their slow and sloppy work. She also accused Van der Sloot and his friends of raping and killing her daughter and demanded that they be brought to justice. She appeared on numerous TV shows, wrote a book, founded a foundation, and called for a boycott of Aruba.</p><p>The Aruban government defended its efforts and expressed sympathy for Holloway's family. It also cooperated with the US authorities and offered rewards for information leading to the resolution of the case. However, it faced criticism from some US officials, media outlets, and tourists who accused it of being incompetent, corrupt, or indifferent. Some also called for a boycott of Aruba as a travel destination until Holloway's case was solved.</p><h6>Natalee Holloway, Joran van der Sloot, Aruba, Peru</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
