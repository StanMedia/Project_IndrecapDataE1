The group, called Ultima Generazione or Last Generation, said on their website that their action was meant to "sound the alarm about the black future that awaits humanity."</p><p>"Our future is as black as this water," the group said. "Without water, there is no life and with rising temperatures, we are exposed to drought on the one hand and floods on the other. Difficult years await us but if we don't reach zero emissions immediately they will be terrible."</p><p>The protesters, wearing orange vests, stood waist deep in the fountain and unfolded orange banners bearing the same message in Italian as crowds of onlookers snapped pictures. They were arrested by police about 15 minutes later and are facing charges of defacing a public monument.</p><h2>A historic and artistic treasure</h2><p>The Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, located in the famed Piazza Navona square in Rome, was designed by Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1651. It represents four major rivers of the four continents through which papal authority had spread: the Nile representing Africa, the Danube representing Europe, the Ganges representing Asia, and the Rio de la Plata representing America.</p><p>The fountain is considered one of the most iconic works of art in Italy and a symbol of Rome's cultural heritage. It has been featured in many films and books, such as Dan Brown's Angels and Demons.</p><p>Italy's Minister of Culture Gennaro Sangiuliano condemned the activists' protest and said those responsible must "pay out of their own pockets."</p><p>"We have to record yet another defacement that endangers the beauty of one of our nation's iconic works of art," Sangiuliano said. "As I have explained many times, these are acts against the environment which they claim to want to defend because the notion of landscape includes what beautiful things over centuries of history human genius has produced."</p><p>Sangiuliano added that the protesters were "eco-vandals" and hoped that Parliament would approve new regulations against them as soon as possible.</p><h2>A series of controversial protests</h2><p>This is not the first time that Last Generation has stirred up public attention with their civil disobedience actions. The group claims to be inspired by Extinction Rebellion, a global movement that uses nonviolent direct action to demand urgent action on the climate crisis.</p><p>According to their website, Last Generation has previously staged protests at other Italian historical sites such as the Barcaccia fountain at the base of the Spanish Steps in central Rome, where they poured black liquid into the fountain on April 1. They have also glued themselves to Italian art masterpieces in locations like the Vatican museums and Uffizi galleries in Florence.</p><p>"It is absurd that this gesture should shock you when we are experiencing a drought emergency that is putting agriculture, energy production in crisis," the group said of their protest at the Barcaccia fountain. "We are not destroying anything but we are trying to save everything."</p><p>Last Generation has also targeted famous artworks such as Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Vincent Van Gogh's Sunflowers, and Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring with spray paint and soup. They said their aim was to highlight the "irreversible damage" that climate change is causing to nature and culture.</p><p>Their actions have sparked outrage and criticism from many art lovers, museum directors, and authorities who have denounced them as vandals and criminals who are harming Italy's artistic heritage.</p><h2>A global issue</h2><p>Last Generation's protest at the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi comes amid growing concern about the impact of climate change on Italy and the world. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2022 was one of the three warmest years on record, with global average temperatures reaching 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The report also warned that extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires, and storms have become more frequent and intense due to human-induced climate change. These events have caused significant loss of life, property, and ecosystem services around the world.</p><p>Italy is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change in Europe, according to a study by the European Environment Agency (EEA). The study found that Italy faces multiple climate hazards such as heat stress, water scarcity, river and coastal flooding, landslides, forest fires, and biodiversity loss.</p><p>The EEA estimated that Italy suffered economic losses of more than 60 billion euros (68 billion US dollars) due to weather and climate-related disasters between 1980 and 2017. The most costly events were the 2016 Central Italy earthquakes (23.5 billion euros), the 2000 floods in northern Italy (11.8 billion euros), and the 2003 European heatwave (8.1 billion euros).</p><p>Climate change also poses serious threats to Italy's cultural heritage, which includes thousands of monuments, archaeological sites, museums, and artworks of global significance. A report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) warned that climate change could damage or destroy many of these treasures due to rising sea levels, coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion, flooding, landslides, fires, and biological attacks.</p><p>Some of the most iconic sites at risk include Venice and its lagoon, the archaeological areas of Pompeii and Herculaneum, the historic centers of Rome, Florence, and Naples, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p><h2>A call for urgent action</h2><p>Last Generation's protest at the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi coincides with the start of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders are expected to agree on concrete actions to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as set by the Paris Agreement in 2015.</p><p>Italy is co-hosting the summit with the United Kingdom and has played a key role in preparing the negotiations. Italy has also pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>However, Last Generation argues that these commitments are not enough and that more radical measures are needed to avoid catastrophic consequences for humanity and the planet.</p><p>The group demands that Italy declares a state of climate emergency and adopts a "Green New Deal" that would phase out fossil fuels, promote renewable energy sources, invest in public transport and green infrastructure, protect biodiversity and natural resources, and ensure social justice and equity.</p><p>The group also calls for more public awareness and participation in the fight against climate change. They invite citizens to join their protests and civil disobedience actions across Italy and to support their cause through donations and social media campaigns.</p><p>"We are not criminals or vandals. We are ordinary people who care about our future and our children's future," the group said. "We are not afraid of being arrested or fined because we know we are doing the right thing. We are fighting for our survival and for a better world."</p><h6>Climate change, Italy, protest, fountain</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
