They were greeted by hundreds of cheering spectators at the Memphis International Airport, in a moment that symbolized the friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries at the time.</p><p>Two decades later, as Ya Ya bid farewell to the US and boarded a plane heading back to China on Wednesday, she has become a symbol of deteriorating relations between the world's two superpowers, which have fallen to their lowest point in half a century. She is set to land in Shanghai later Thursday, carried home on board a special FedEx "panda express" plane, Chinese state media reported.</p><p>Ya Ya's return to China has been eagerly awaited by many Chinese people, especially after Le Le died suddenly of heart disease in early February. Unlike the chubby, fluffy image of her younger self, 22-year-old Ya Ya has appeared skinny in recent photos, with her black and white coat missing clumps of fur.</p><p>Many in China have been shocked and saddened by her condition. Some believed she had not been given proper care and attention -- an accusation first levied by animal advocates in 2021 but denied repeatedly by the Memphis Zoo. The zoo said Ya Ya's weight loss was due to her old age and that she had received regular check-ups and treatments.</p><h2>Panda diplomacy</h2><p>As part of China's "panda diplomacy," these bears are meant to serve as an envoy of friendship between China and their host country. China has been sending pandas abroad since the 1950s, often as gifts to mark diplomatic milestones or to foster goodwill.</p><p>However, since the 1980s, China has changed its policy and started to loan pandas instead of giving them away, usually for a period of 10 years with an option to renew. The host country also has to pay a hefty annual fee to China for panda conservation and research, as well as return any cubs born abroad to China when they reach four years old.</p><p>According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), there are currently 58 pandas living in 17 zoos across 13 countries outside China. The US has 18 pandas in four zoos: Atlanta Zoo, Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington DC, San Diego Zoo and Memphis Zoo.</p><p>Pandas are considered a national treasure in China and a symbol of its soft power. They are also an endangered species, with only about 1,800 living in the wild and 600 in captivity, according to China's State Forestry and Grassland Administration.</p><h2>Nationalist sentiment</h2><p>But for Chinese nationalists, Ya Ya has become a glaring symbol of what they see as America's bullying and suppression of China. On Weibo, China's heavily censored Twitter-like platform, many users have expressed anger and resentment towards the US for its treatment of Ya Ya.</p><p>"Treating our national treasure with such an attitude is an outright provocation of China," said one comment.</p><p>"Bring Ya Ya home! The US is not worthy of having pandas!" said another.</p><p>Some users also compared Ya Ya's condition with that of two playful, energetic pandas at the Moscow Zoo, Ru Yi and Ding Ding, who celebrated their third birthday last month with a special cake. The apparent contrast between the pandas in the US and Russia was seized on by Chinese state media, which has taken on a pro-Russian stance since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and regularly fanned anti-US sentiment.</p><p>"Look at how happy our pandas are in Russia! They are treated like VIPs there!" said one Weibo user.</p><p>"Pandas are our best friends. Russia is our best friend. The US is our enemy," said another.</p><p>The heated discussions about Ya Ya reflect the growing nationalist sentiment in China, especially among young people who have grown up under President Xi Jinping's rule. Xi has promoted a more assertive foreign policy and a more confident national identity, often clashing with the US on issues such as trade, human rights, Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has also exacerbated tensions between the two countries, with former US President Donald Trump blaming China for the virus outbreak and calling it the "China virus" or the "kung flu." The two countries have also engaged in a series of tit-for-tat actions, such as closing consulates, expelling journalists, imposing sanctions and restricting visas.</p><p>The Biden administration has maintained a tough stance on China, calling it "the most serious competitor" to the US and vowing to confront its "abuses" on trade, technology and human rights. However, it has also signaled a willingness to cooperate with China on areas of mutual interest, such as climate change, public health and nuclear nonproliferation.</p><h2>Global implications</h2><p>The fate of Ya Ya and other pandas abroad has implications not only for US-China relations, but also for global conservation efforts and public education. Pandas are among the most popular and charismatic animals in the world, attracting millions of visitors to zoos every year. They also help raise awareness and funds for protecting their habitats and other endangered species.</p><p>According to WWF, pandas play a crucial role in the bamboo forests where they live by spreading seeds and facilitating the growth of vegetation. They also share their home with many other animals, such as golden monkeys, takins, red pandas and snow leopards.</p><p>However, pandas face many threats from human activities, such as habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation due to logging, mining, agriculture and infrastructure development. They are also vulnerable to poaching, diseases and climate change.</p><p>The cooperation between China and other countries on panda conservation has yielded positive results over the years. According to China's latest national census in 2014, the wild panda population has increased by 17% since 2003, reaching 1,864 individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has also changed the status of pandas from "endangered" to "vulnerable" in 2016.</p><p>But the challenges remain. The IUCN warned that climate change could eliminate more than one-third of the panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years and reverse the gains made so far. It also urged China to continue its efforts to expand and improve panda reserves and corridors.</p><p>The pandemic has also posed new risks for pandas and other wildlife. The lockdowns and travel restrictions have reduced the revenue of many zoos around the world, forcing them to cut staff, services and conservation programs. Some zoos have even faced the threat of closure or bankruptcy.</p><p>The pandemic has also highlighted the need to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases -- those that can jump from animals to humans -- by addressing their root causes, such as wildlife trade, consumption and habitat destruction.</p><p>As Ya Ya returns to her homeland after 20 years abroad, she leaves behind a legacy of joy and wonder for millions of Americans who have seen her grow up at the Memphis Zoo. She also leaves behind a lesson for the world: that pandas are not just cute and cuddly creatures, but also ambassadors of peace and conservation that deserve our respect and protection.</p><h6>Ya Ya, panda diplomacy, US-China relations, conservation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
