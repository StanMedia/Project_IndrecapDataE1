According to its website, it began to use the slogan "The Champagne of Bottle Beer" three years after its launch in 1903, and shortened it to "The Champagne of Beers" in 1969. The beer has also been available in champagne-style 750-milliliter bottles during festive seasons.</p><p>However, this slogan has not gone down well with the French Champagne industry, which claims that the term "Champagne" should be reserved only for the sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region of France, using specific grapes and methods. The Comité Champagne, a joint trade association for the Champagne industry, argued that the slogan infringed on the protected designation of origin "Champagne", which is recognized by the European Union and other countries.</p><h2>Belgian customs intercept and destroy the beer shipment</h2><p>In February 2023, Belgian customs authorities intercepted a shipment of 2,352 cans of Miller High Life at the port of Antwerp. The shipment was destined for Germany, but was seized after the Comité Champagne requested its destruction. The buyer in Germany "was informed and did not contest the decision", according to the trade organization.</p><p>On April 17, 2023, the cans were destroyed "with the greatest respect for environmental concerns by ensuring that the entire batch, content and container, is recycled in an eco-responsible way", the Comité Champagne said in a statement. The destruction was carried out at the Westlandia plant in Ypres, Belgium, where workers dumped the empty cans into a machine to be crushed.</p><p>Kristian Vanderwaeren, general administrator of the Belgian General Administration for Customs and Excise, said that "each year we carry out thousands of checks on designations of controlled origin. If a counterfeit is proven, as is the case here, we also consult each other on the decision to destroy these goods and on the way in which we have them destroyed."</p><p>Charles Goemaere, managing director of the Comité Champagne, said that the move was the result of successful collaboration between the Belgian customs authorities and the services of the Champagne Committee. "It confirms the importance that the European Union attaches to designations of origin and rewards the determination of the inhabitants of Champagne to protect their designation", he said.</p><h2>Molson Coors Beverage Co. responds to the incident</h2><p>Molson Coors Beverage Co., which owns the Miller High Life brand, said in a statement that "with its elegant, clear-glass bottle and crisp taste, Miller High Life has proudly worn the nickname 'The Champagne of Beers' for almost 120 years". The company also said that it does not currently export Miller High Life to the EU, and did not comment on who had ordered the beers.</p><p>The company added that "we respect all laws and regulations governing our products around the world and will continue to work with our partners to ensure compliance".</p><p>The incident is not the first time that the French Champagne industry has clashed with other producers over the use of its name. In July 2021, France and Russia were involved in a diplomatic dispute over a new Russian law that required foreign producers of sparkling wine to label their products as such, while allowing Russian producers to use "Champagne" on their bottles. The law prompted some French Champagne makers to suspend their exports to Russia until a solution was found.</p><h2>Miller High Life: The Champagne of Beers</h2><p>Miller High Life is a beer that overcomes low expectations with elevated carbonation. Introduced by the Miller Brewing Company around New Year’s Eve of 1903, the beverage made its debut into civil society in a stunning clear-glass number, with gold foil wrapped around its gazelle-like neck and plunging shoulders.</p><p>The beer was created by Frederick Miller, a German immigrant who founded the Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee in 1855. He brought with him a special brewer's yeast that gave his beer a distinctive flavor and quality.</p><p>Miller High Life is a pilsner-style beer with a light golden color and a crisp, refreshing taste. It has an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 4.6% and a moderate bitterness of 7 International Bitterness Units (IBUs).</p><p>The beer is noted for its high level of carbonation, which gives it a champagne-like effervescence and mouthfeel. This led to its longtime slogan "The Champagne of Beers", which was first used in 1906.</p><p>Miller High Life was one of the premier high-end beers in the US for many years, until it lost its popularity to lighter and cheaper beers in the 1960s and 1970s. However, it regained some of its appeal in the 1990s and 2000s, thanks to its retro image and affordable price.</p><p>Today, Miller High Life is sold in clear glass bottles, cans, and draught. It is brewed at various locations across the US by the Miller Brewing Company, which is now a subsidiary of Molson Coors.</p><p>Miller High Life has won several awards over the years, including gold medals at the World Beer Cup and the Great American Beer Festival. It has also been featured in various movies, TV shows, and songs as a symbol of American culture and lifestyle.</p><h6>Belgium, Miller High Life, Champagne, beer, customs</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
