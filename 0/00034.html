On July 1, 1942, it was carrying about 1,060 prisoners from around 16 countries, including 850 Australian service members, from the former Australian territory of New Guinea to what was then the Japanese-occupied island of Hainan. The ship had no markings or flags to indicate that it was carrying prisoners of war.</p><p>The ship was spotted by an American submarine, USS Sturgeon, off the coast of the Philippine island of Luzon. The submarine fired four torpedoes at the ship, two of which hit and caused it to sink rapidly. There were no survivors among the prisoners or the Japanese crew. It was Australia's worst maritime disaster and one of the largest losses of life at sea in World War II.</p><h2>The search for the shipwreck</h2><p>The location of the shipwreck remained unknown for 81 years, until a team of researchers and explorers found it in April 2023. The team was led by not-for-profit Silentworld Foundation, deep-sea survey specialists Fugro and supported by the Department of Defence. They used an autonomous underwater vehicle to scan the seabed at a depth of more than 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) in the South China Sea, northwest of Luzon.</p><p>After 12 days of searching, they detected a large metal object that matched the dimensions and shape of the Montevideo Maru. They then confirmed its identity by comparing its features with historical records and photographs. They also found debris and artifacts around the wreck, such as lifeboats, anchors and cargo.</p><h2>The reaction and significance of the discovery</h2><p>The discovery of the shipwreck was announced by Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on April 22, 2023. He said it brought an end to "one of the most tragic chapters in Australia's maritime history" and provided closure to the families of those who lost their lives.</p><p>He also praised the team that found the wreck for their dedication and perseverance. "The absence of a location of the Montevideo Maru has represented unfinished business for the families of those who lost their lives," he said. "This is an extraordinary achievement by an extraordinary group of people."</p><p>The Chief of the Australian Army Lieutenant General Simon Stuart also thanked the team and expressed his condolences to the relatives of the victims. "I want to thank the Silentworld team and the dedicated researchers, including the Unrecovered War Casualties team at Army, who have never given up hope of finding the final resting place of the Montevideo Maru," he said. "A loss like this reaches down through the decades and reminds us all of the human cost of conflict. Lest We Forget."</p><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also commented on the discovery and its significance for Australia's history and memory. "The extraordinary effort behind this discovery speaks for the enduring truth of Australia's solemn national promise to always remember and honor those who served our country," he said. "This is the heart and the spirit of Lest We Forget."</p><h6>SS Montevideo Maru, World War II, South China Sea, shipwreck</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
