In the past, the space agency has relied on radio signals beamed through its Deep Space Network to transmit any sort of scientific data from deep space probes back to Earth. Lasers, however, have the ability to vastly increase the amount of data spacecraft are able to send, and NASA is ready to send the technology around the moon.</p><p>NASA is including laser communications in the form of the Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System (O2O) terminal on Artemis II, the next crewed mission around the moon. The O2O system will be capable of returning high-resolution images and video of the lunar surface back to Earth with a downlink rate of up to 260 megabits per second¹. The high bandwidth, a far cry from the grainy footage captured during the Apollo missions 50 years ago, could enable high-definition views of the moon in real time.</p><p>The O2O system will also be able to send and receive procedures, flight plans, voice messages and other communications between the Orion spacecraft and mission control on Earth¹. "By infusing new laser communications technologies into the Artemis missions, we're empowering our astronauts with more access to data than ever before," said O2O Project Manager Steve Horowitz in a statement¹. "The higher the data rates, the more information our instruments can send home to Earth, and the more science our lunar explorers can perform."</p><h2>Artemis II to test laser communications around the moon</h2><p>Artemis II is scheduled to launch in November 2024 atop the Space Launch System rocket. The mission will carry NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency on a roughly 10-day journey beyond the moon and back². Along for the historic journey to the moon will be the O2O system, making Artemis II the first crewed lunar flight to demonstrate laser communications technology.</p><p>The O2O system will consist of a small optical terminal mounted on top of Orion's crew module adapter. The terminal will use a telescope and a laser transmitter to send data encoded in infrared light beams from Orion to Earth. The terminal will also use a camera and a laser receiver to detect and track signals from ground stations on Earth¹.</p><p>The O2O system will communicate with two ground stations: one at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory in California, and another at ESA's Optical Ground Station in Tenerife, Spain¹. These stations will use large telescopes and sensitive detectors to receive and decode the laser signals from Orion. They will also use powerful lasers to send signals back to Orion.</p><p>The O2O system will operate in parallel with Orion's existing radio communication system, which will serve as a backup in case of any issues with the laser system. The O2O system will also be able to switch between different modes of operation depending on Orion's position and orientation relative to Earth¹.</p><h2>Laser communications pave the way for future missions</h2><p>The O2O system on Artemis II is not NASA's first experiment with laser communications. The agency has launched several demonstration satellites in recent years to test and refine the technology. The Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) launched in December 2021 was the agency's first laser relay. That was followed by the TeraByte InfraRed Delivery (TBIRD) CubeSat launched last year, which reached data transmission rates of 200 gigabits per second³.</p><p>Now, NASA is preparing the Integrated LCRD Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T), which is expected to launch to the International Space Station (ISS) later this year. ILLUMA-T will attach to the exposed facility on the Japanese Experiment Module. Once operational, ILLUMA-T will relay data back to Earth through LCRD in NASA's first end-to-end laser relay communications system³.</p><p>These experiments are "only the start of how laser communications are paving the way for advancing our scientific discoveries," according to NASA. The success of these experiments will inform and enable future missions that will rely on laser communications, such as the Gateway lunar outpost, the Europa Clipper mission to Jupiter's icy moon, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope . Laser communications will also be essential for human exploration of Mars and beyond, as they will allow astronauts to stay connected with Earth and share their discoveries in unprecedented detail.</p><h2>Artemis II to fly the first astronauts around the moon since Apollo</h2><p>Artemis II is the second mission of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon by the end of the decade. Artemis II will be the first crewed mission to fly around the moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972. The mission will test Orion's systems and capabilities in deep space, as well as demonstrate the feasibility of human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit.</p><p>Artemis II is scheduled to launch in November 2024 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission will use the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the most powerful rocket ever built by NASA. The SLS will launch the Orion spacecraft and its crew of four astronauts into orbit around Earth. From there, Orion will use its own propulsion system to escape Earth's gravity and head towards the moon.</p><p>The mission will last about 10 days, during which Orion will perform a series of maneuvers to adjust its trajectory and enter a lunar orbit. Orion will fly as close as 60 miles (97 kilometers) above the lunar surface, allowing the astronauts to see the moon's features in stunning detail. Orion will also fly over the lunar south pole, where NASA plans to land future missions.</p><p>The mission will also include a number of scientific and technological objectives, such as conducting experiments on board Orion, testing Orion's life support and communication systems, and collecting data on the radiation environment in deep space. The mission will also demonstrate the O2O laser communication system, which will enable high-speed transmission of data and video between Orion and Earth.</p><p>After completing one or more orbits around the moon, Orion will use its propulsion system to leave lunar orbit and return to Earth. Orion will reenter Earth's atmosphere at a speed of about 25,000 miles per hour (40,000 kilometers per hour), generating temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius). Orion will deploy a series of parachutes to slow down and splash down in the Pacific Ocean, where it will be recovered by a Navy ship.</p><p>Artemis II will be a historic milestone for human space exploration, as it will mark the return of humans to the vicinity of the moon after nearly 50 years. The mission will also pave the way for Artemis III, which will land two astronauts on the lunar surface in 2026. The Artemis program aims to establish a sustainable presence on the moon and use it as a stepping stone for future missions to Mars and beyond.</p><h6>Artemis II, laser communications, Orion, moon, NASA</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
