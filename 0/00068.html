We have to de-escalate this situation," said de Silva, who is also founder and president of Trunks and Leaves a non-profit dedicated to the conservation of wild Asian elephants and their habitats.</p><p>The study found that the greatest decline in elephant habitats was in China, where 94% of suitable land was lost between 1700 and 2015. That was followed by India, which lost 86%.</p><p>Meanwhile, more than half of suitable elephant habitats have been lost in Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia's Sumatra. Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka also saw a significant decline – mostly in areas where elephants still roam today.</p><p>"Restoring these habitats doesn't necessarily mean keeping them static. Instead we need to better understand the role of people (rural agriculturalists, indigenous communities) who are often marginalized in the economic systems that have been put in place," de Silva said.</p><p>"We also need to reckon with how these dynamics can be maintained sustainably, given the current and future human population size as well as climate change."</p><h2>Colonization sped up the loss of habitat</h2><p>Researchers found there was an acceleration in elephant habitat loss from the year 1700, which coincided with the expansion of European colonization of the region.</p><p>During this time, logging, road-building, resource extraction and deforestation ramped up, and farming became more intense on land that might otherwise have hosted wildlife.</p><p>The era also saw "new value systems, market forces, and governance policies" reaching beyond the cities of Europe into the forests of Asia – speeding up elephant habitat loss and the fragmentation of the species, the study found.</p><p>The researchers used historical maps and satellite imagery to reconstruct how elephant habitats changed over time. They also used data from previous studies on elephant distribution and population estimates.</p><p>They found that while some countries have seen an increase in elephant numbers in recent decades – such as Nepal and Bhutan – this does not necessarily mean a recovery of their habitats.</p><p>Instead, it may reflect a concentration of elephants into smaller areas due to human encroachment or conservation efforts.</p><h2>Elephants need more space and connectivity</h2><p>The researchers said that while there are many initiatives to protect elephants and their habitats across Asia, more needs to be done to ensure their long-term survival.</p><p>They called for more transboundary cooperation among countries that share elephant populations, as well as more support for local communities that live alongside elephants.</p><p>They also stressed the importance of maintaining connectivity among elephant habitats, which allows them to disperse and access resources.</p><p>"Elephants need space. They are large animals that range widely across landscapes. They are also highly intelligent animals with complex social lives," de Silva said.</p><p>"Without sufficient space for movement or access to resources they need for survival (food/water), they will suffer physically as well as psychologically."</p><p>De Silva said that while there is no single solution to address the habitat crisis facing Asian elephants, there is hope for their future if people work together to conserve them.</p><p>"Elephants are resilient animals that have survived many challenges over millennia. They are also adaptable animals that can coexist with people under certain conditions," she said.</p><p>"We need to recognize their value as part of our natural heritage and respect their right to exist."</p><h6>Asian elephants, habitat loss, deforestation, human-elephant conflict</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
