The Justice Department also charged 34 officers of China's national police with related offenses.</p><h2>The US accuses China of exporting authoritarian methods to stifle free expression</h2><p>"We don't need or want a secret police station in our great city," said Breon Peace, the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York on Monday – expressing the likely feeling of many Americans at the news that the FBI has arrested two alleged agents for the Chinese government accused of working to harass and silence its critics in the US.</p><p>The Justice Department also charged 34 officers of China's national police, all of whom are believed to live in China, with related offenses.</p><p>The revelations threaten to pitch already sour US-China relations into further crisis, and had the immediate effect of hardening bipartisan suspicion about Beijing on Capitol Hill in a way that will have serious diplomatic implications.</p><p>Prosecutors allege that China opened an "undeclared police station" in New York City that was used at least once to track down a pro-democracy activist of Chinese descent living in California.</p><p>The two men Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping — both US citizens — allegedly created the "first known overseas police station in the United States," on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, according to the Justice Department.</p><p>The FBI also accused a group of Chinese officers of flooding an online video conference, screaming at and threatening Chinese dissidents in the US who were discussing democracy.</p><p>This is not unsurprising activity by a foreign intelligence agency on foreign soil; Washington's penchant for engaging democracy activists in totalitarian countries has, for instance, long been seen as meddling by repressive governments. And the FBI has outposts in many foreign embassies.</p><p>The bureau's work, however, involves fighting organized crime, combating terrorism and drug trafficking, and forging links with local police and law enforcement. It isn't designed to monitor US expats and police their political activity.</p><p>If proven, the two agents' alleged activities represent an attempt by the Communist Party in Beijing to extend its crackdown on dissent and democracy outside the country and onto the soil of a nation where such freedoms are protected.</p><p>"The efforts of the PRC to export authoritarian methods to stifle free expression in the United States is a threat to America's democracy that we will not abide," said David Newman, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the National Security Division of the Department of Justice.</p><p>There has so far been no comment from Beijing on the charges. But the notion that Beijing is operating foreign police stations is not new.</p><p>According to a new report by Madrid-based human rights group Safeguard Defenders shared with CNN last year, President Xi Jinping's government set up more than 100 such posts to monitor the activity of large Chinese diasporas, using bilateral security arrangements as a cover.</p><h2>The US and China are locked in a geopolitical rivalry</h2><p>The arrests and charges come at a time when the US and China are locked in a geopolitical rivalry that spans trade, technology, human rights, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.</p><p>The Biden administration has maintained a tough stance on China inherited from former President Donald Trump, while also seeking areas of cooperation on issues such as climate change and nuclear non-proliferation.</p><p>However, tensions have flared over several flashpoints in recent months, including Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, its military pressure on Taiwan and its alleged genocide against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.</p><p>The US has also accused China of engaging in cyberattacks, economic espionage and intellectual property theft against American interests.</p><p>China has denied these allegations and accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs and undermining its sovereignty and security.</p><p>China has also ramped up its propaganda efforts to counter Western criticism and promote its own narrative on global issues.</p><p>In October 2021, China launched an English-language news channel called CGTN America to compete with CNN and other international media outlets. The channel aims to provide "a different perspective" on world events and showcase China's achievements and contributions.</p><p>China has also expanded its network of Confucius Institutes around the world, which offer language and cultural courses but have been criticized by some as vehicles for spreading Beijing's influence and propaganda.</p><h2>The US and China have different views on democracy and human rights</h2><p>One of the key sources of friction between the US and China is their different views on democracy and human rights.</p><p>The US sees itself as a champion of democracy and human rights around the world and supports civil society movements and opposition groups that challenge authoritarian regimes.</p><p>The US also criticizes China for its human rights violations and repression of dissent at home and abroad, and imposes sanctions and other measures to pressure Beijing to change its behavior.</p><p>China sees itself as a defender of sovereignty and non-interference in other countries' affairs and rejects Western values and standards as universal or superior.</p><p>China also accuses the US of hypocrisy and double standards on human rights issues, and blames Washington for instigating unrest and chaos in regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang.</p><p>China also asserts its right to develop its own political system and social model according to its national conditions and historical traditions, and claims that it respects the diversity of civilizations and cultures in the world.</p><p>China also argues that it has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and improved their living standards and social welfare, which it considers as the most basic human right.</p><h2>The US and China need to manage their differences and avoid confrontation</h2><p>Despite their differences and disputes, the US and China are also the world's two largest economies and have significant interdependence and common interests.</p><p>The US and China are both permanent members of the UN Security Council and have a responsibility to maintain international peace and security.</p><p>The US and China are also both signatories of the Paris Agreement on climate change and have pledged to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming.</p><p>The US and China are also both parties to the Iran nuclear deal and have a shared interest in preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p><p>The US and China are also both affected by global challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic, terrorism, cybercrime, nuclear proliferation, drug trafficking and transnational crime.</p><p>The US and China therefore need to manage their differences and avoid confrontation that could escalate into conflict or war.</p><p>The US and China need to respect each other's core interests and red lines, while seeking dialogue and cooperation on areas of mutual benefit.</p><p>The US and China need to enhance communication and coordination on regional and global issues, while avoiding miscalculation and misunderstanding.</p><p>The US and China need to foster people-to-people exchanges and cultural understanding, while reducing mistrust and hostility.</p><p>The US and China need to uphold the principles of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, while building a new type of major power relationship in the 21st century.</p><h6>US, China, secret police station, arrests, showdown</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
