Local media, citing the police, reported that Moonbin had been found unresponsive on Wednesday evening in his apartment in the upscale Gangnam neighbourhood of Seoul.</p><p>The police are currently investigating the cause of death but have so far found no signs of foul play, according to the Yonhap news agency. Officials at Seoul’s Gangnam district police station did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Moonbin "unexpectedly left our world and became a star in the sky", his music label Fantiago said on Twitter. It said that fellow artists were mourning him in a state of "very deep sadness and shock".</p><p>"Please refrain from speculative and malicious reporting for the bereaved family who have received this sad news unexpectedly and let them mourn in reverence." the statement added. The family will be holding a funeral with friends and colleagues as privately as possible, it said.</p><p>The statement did not contain any information regarding the cause of death. Local media reported that one Astro member had taken an urgent leave from the country’s military and that another had cut a trip to the U.S. short in the wake of the news. His sister, Moon Sua, is also a K-pop celebrity, being a member of the girl group Billlie. The group has canceled or postponed all scheduled events in the wake of her brother’s death, as have other K-pop figures.</p><h2>A lifelong career</h2><p>Moon Bin, born Jan. 26,1998, was an actor and model before joining Astro. He entered showbiz as a child actor and model in the 2000s. He had his acting debut in 2009, when as an 11-year-old he starred in the popular Korean drama series Boys Over Flowers.</p><p>At age 18, he joined Astro. The six-member groups debuted in 2016 after the members had appeared in a popular reality show. It quickly found success in both South Korea and Japan, with Billboard listing Astro on the top 10 list of new K-pop groups that year. The group released three full-length albums, 10 EPs, and two single albums. Hit songs include "Candy Sugar Pop." "All Night." "Crazy Sexy Cool." and more. Moon Bin was also a member of the duo Moonbin &amp; Sanha. On Wednesday their promoter announced the cancellation of a concert in Indonesia "due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control".</p><p>With a career that spanned his entire life, Moonbin was in a rare group of K-pop stars. He was widely popular at home, Rob Schwartz, an Asia correspondent for Billboard Magazine, told the BBC. He added that K-pop idols are under intense pressure from fans on social media to look and sound perfect, while record producers demand they churn out hit after hit.</p><p>"It's crazy how they have these guys under a microscope." he said. "Certainly, stars in the West can more or less keep who they're dating a secret. In the K-pop world, it's impossible to keep a secret. Every time they lift a foot, thousands of lines are written about it."</p><p>He also noted that Moonbin went on hiatus in 2019 and 2020, citing his health. "K-pop artists don't really have a life outside being a pop star. They start training at a very young age. They don't go to school or make regular friends. It's really hard for them to see life outside the K-pop world." he said.</p><h2>A wave of grief</h2><p>The unexpected loss prompted an outpouring of shock and sadness on social media throughout Thursday, with fans thanking Moon Bin for his work and expressing sympathy. Pictures online showed fans laying flowers and notes at street memorials in South Korea and elsewhere in the world, including in the US, Chile, Indonesia and the Philippines. Some also strung up purple and silver balloons - colours that had featured prominently at the singer's last performance in Thailand.</p><p>"Rest in peace, Moonbin.I hope the stars and the moon treat you well. I hope they give you all the comfort and love." one person wrote on Twitter.</p><p>"Moonbin, your smile will light up the night." another wrote.</p><p>Moon Bin’s death is the latest such case among prominent young celebrities in South Korea, a trend that has prompted the country to reflect on the pressure faced by stars in the fast-growing entertainment industry, a toxic online fan culture and attitudes toward mental health.</p><p>In recent years, several K-pop stars have died by suicide or in accidents, raising concerns over the mental health of young artists in the highly competitive and demanding industry. Some of the most notable cases include Jonghyun of SHINee in 2017, Sulli of f(x) and Goo Hara of Kara in 2019, and Cha In-ha of Surprise U in 2019.</p><p>Experts have called for more support and awareness for K-pop stars who may struggle with depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and cyberbullying. They have also urged fans to respect the privacy and personal lives of their idols and to refrain from spreading malicious rumours or comments.</p><p>K-pop is one of South Korea's most successful cultural exports, generating billions of dollars in revenue and attracting millions of fans around the world. The country's government has supported the industry as a way of boosting its soft power and global influence. However, some critics have argued that the industry needs to reform its practices and policies to ensure the well-being and dignity of its artists.</p><h6>Moonbin, Astro, K-pop, death, suicide</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
