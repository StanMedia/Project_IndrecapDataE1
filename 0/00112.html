The mine is located in a remote area of the Chala district, about 600 km (370 miles) south of the capital Lima.</p><p>The fire quickly spread through the tunnels and shafts of the mine, where about 30 workers were working at depths ranging from 80 to 100 meters (260 to 330 feet). Only two people managed to escape the inferno, while the rest were trapped and suffocated by the smoke and flames.</p><p>Images on local media and social media showed dark plumes of smoke rising from the hillside where the mine is located. Relatives of the missing miners arrived at the scene on Sunday morning, but were denied access to the site for safety reasons.</p><h2>Rescue efforts hampered by distance and lack of equipment</h2><p>The local government said in a statement that the nearest police station was about 90 minutes away from the mine, and the closest city, Arequipa, was several hours away by road. This complicated the emergency response and delayed the arrival of rescue teams and firefighters.</p><p>Some 30 specialist officers from the national police and the public prosecutor's office reached the site on Sunday afternoon to secure the mine and begin recovery efforts. However, they faced difficulties due to the lack of adequate equipment and ventilation systems.</p><p>"It's been confirmed by the Yanaquihua police station, there are 27 dead," local prosecutor Giovanni Matos told local television on Sunday. He added that the bodies would be taken to a morgue in Chala for identification.</p><h2>The worst mining accident in Peru since 2000</h2><p>Peru is one of the world's top gold producers and second-largest copper producer. It has a large and diverse mining sector that employs hundreds of thousands of people, mostly in rural areas.</p><p>However, mining accidents are frequent and often fatal, especially in small-scale and informal mines that lack proper safety standards and regulations. According to data from Peru's ministry of energy and mines, 38 people were killed in mining accidents around the country in 2022.</p><p>The fire at La Esperanza mine is the single deadliest mining accident in Peru since 2000, when a landslide at a copper mine in southern Peru killed 28 people. It has sparked outrage and calls for more oversight and accountability in the mining industry.</p><p>President Pedro Castillo expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and ordered an investigation into the causes and responsibilities of the tragedy. He also pledged to improve working conditions and safety measures for miners across the country.</p><h2>Peru’s mining industry</h2><p>Peru is one of the most mineral-rich countries in the world, with abundant reserves of gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead, tin and other metals. According to the World Bank, mining accounts for about 10% of Peru’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 60% of its exports.</p><p>Peru is the world’s top gold producer, producing more than 100 tonnes of gold a year, or about 4% of the global supply. Gold mining is mainly concentrated in the southern regions of Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cusco and Puno. Most of the gold is extracted by small-scale and informal miners, who often work in hazardous conditions and face environmental and social challenges.</p><p>Peru is also the second-largest copper producer in the world, after Chile, with an output of 2.4 million metric tons in 2019. Copper mining is mainly located in the central and northern regions of Ancash, Apurimac, Cajamarca, Cusco, Lima and Moquegua. Peru has several large-scale copper projects, such as Las Bambas, Antamina, Cerro Verde and Toromocho, as well as many exploration and development projects.</p><p>Mining is a key driver of Peru’s economic growth and development, but it also poses significant challenges for the environment and human rights. Mining activities have caused deforestation, water pollution, soil erosion, biodiversity loss and social conflicts. Mining communities often suffer from poverty, inequality, health problems and human rights violations. The Peruvian government has been trying to improve the regulation and oversight of the mining sector, as well as promote dialogue and consultation with local stakeholders.</p><h6>Peru, gold mine, fire, accident</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
