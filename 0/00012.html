During its 16 years of operation, it observed solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which are the sun's explosive eruptions of plasma and magnetic fields.</p><p>The spacecraft was equipped with an imaging spectrometer, which recorded the sun's X-rays and gamma rays. These high-energy emissions reveal information about the temperature, density and acceleration of the particles involved in solar flares.</p><p>Before RHESSI, no gamma-ray images or high-energy X-ray images had been taken of solar flares, and data from the spacecraft provided vital clues about the phenomena and their associated coronal mass ejections.</p><p>These solar events release the energy equivalent of billions of megatons of TNT into the sun's atmosphere within minutes and can have effects on Earth, such as disrupting electrical systems, damaging satellites and causing auroras.</p><p>Over the years, RHESSI documented the huge range in solar flare size, from tiny nanoflares to massive superflares that were tens of thousands of times bigger and more explosive.</p><h2>RHESSI reenters Earth's atmosphere</h2><p>The retired RHESSI spacecraft is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere Wednesday at approximately 9:30 p.m. ET, according to NASA.</p><p>The agency expects most of the 660-pound spacecraft to burn up as it travels through the atmosphere, but some components are expected to survive reentry.</p><p>The risk of harm coming to anyone on Earth as a result of RHESSI's return is low — approximately 1 in 2,467, according to NASA.</p><p>NASA said that the agency, along with the Department of Defense, would monitor the satellite's reentry into Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>The spacecraft's orbit decayed gradually over time due to atmospheric drag. The orbit also varied depending on solar activity, which affects the density of the upper atmosphere.</p><h2>RHESSI contributed to solar science</h2><p>RHESSI was part of NASA's Living With a Star program, which aims to understand how the sun affects life and society on Earth.</p><p>The spacecraft was named after Reuven Ramaty, a pioneer of high-energy solar physics who worked at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.</p><p>RHESSI's data helped scientists understand how solar flares accelerate particles to near-light speeds, how magnetic reconnection occurs in the sun's atmosphere, how nanoflares heat the solar corona and how superflares differ from regular flares.</p><p>RHESSI also detected gamma-ray emission from terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), which are brief bursts of high-energy radiation associated with thunderstorms on Earth.</p><p>RHESSI's legacy will continue through other missions that study the sun and its activity, such as NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.</p><h6>RHESSI, solar flares</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
