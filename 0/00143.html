For the first time, water was detected in a main belt comet, or a comet located in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The discovery came after 15 years of attempts by astronomers using different observation methods.</p><p>The space observatory detected water vapor around Comet Read, which suggests that water ice can be preserved in a warmer part of the solar system. A study detailing the findings was published on Monday in the journal Nature.</p><p>Comets typically exist in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, icy regions beyond the orbit of Neptune that can preserve some of the frozen materials left over from the formation of the solar system. The comets venture on long, oval-shaped orbits around the sun that can take thousands of years and have streaming tails that develop as the frigid objects occasionally pass close to the sun. Their fuzzy appearance and tails of material differentiate comets from asteroids.</p><p>But a rare subclass of comets called main belt comets are objects in the asteroid belt with circular orbits around the sun that periodically exhibit cometlike behavior, such as shedding material that creates a fuzzy appearance and a trailing tail. Rather than shedding icy material through sublimation, when a solid turns directly to a gas, the main belt comets only seemed to eject dust. Given their location in the warm inner solar system closer to the sun than typical comets, main belt comets weren't expected to retain much ice — until now.</p><p>And the discovery could add more evidence to the theory of how water became a plentiful resource on Earth early in its history. Comets and water-rich asteroids may have collided with early Earth and delivered water to our planet.</p><p>"Our water-soaked world, teeming with life and unique in the universe as far as we know, is something of a mystery — we're not sure how all this water got here," said study coauthor Stefanie Milam, Webb deputy project scientist for planetary science at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "Understanding the history of water distribution in the solar system will help us to understand other planetary systems, and if they could be on their way to hosting an Earth-like planet."</p><h2>A missing ingredient</h2><p>Main belt comets were first codiscovered in 2006 by study coauthor Henry Hsieh, senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona.</p><p>"Main belt comets are fascinating because they challenge our understanding of how ice can survive in such warm regions of our solar system," Hsieh said.</p><p>The team used JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument to observe Comet Read on September 8 last year. The instrument splits light into its component colors to reveal information about an object's temperature, motion and chemical composition.</p><p>The researchers detected water vapor around Comet Read by looking for a specific wavelength of light that is absorbed by water molecules. They also looked for carbon dioxide, another common component of comets that sublimates easily.</p><p>To their surprise, they found no evidence of carbon dioxide around Comet Read, even though previous studies have estimated that it could make up about 10% of the volatile matter in comets.</p><p>The absence of carbon dioxide raises questions about how Comet Read formed and evolved over time. One possibility is that Comet Read had carbon dioxide when it formed, but lost it over billions of years due to warming by the sun. Another possibility is that Comet Read formed in a region of the solar system where carbon dioxide was scarce or absent.</p><p>"Either way, this result tells us something new about how our solar system formed and evolved," said study coauthor Michael Kelley, associate research scientist at University of Maryland's Department of Astronomy.</p><h2>A new window into space</h2><p>The JWST launched on December 25 last year and reached its final destination at Lagrange point 2 on January 29 this year. Lagrange point 2 is a stable spot about 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth where the telescope can observe both Earth and space without interference from sunlight.</p><p>The telescope is currently undergoing testing and calibration before it begins its scientific mission. The telescope is expected to start delivering its first images and data in June this year.</p><p>The JWST is a joint project of NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency. It is designed to observe the infrared light from some of the faintest, oldest and most distant objects in the universe, such as the first galaxies that formed after the big bang, the birth of stars and planets, and the atmospheres of exoplanets.</p><p>The JWST has a suite of four instruments that can perform a variety of observations, from imaging and spectroscopy to coronagraphy and interferometry. The instruments are: the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS).</p><p>The JWST also has a unique feature that sets it apart from other space telescopes: a giant sunshield that unfolds like a flower to protect the telescope from the heat and light of the sun, Earth and moon. The sunshield is made of five layers of thin material that reflect sunlight and radiate heat into space. The sunshield creates a cold and stable environment for the telescope and its instruments, which need to operate at temperatures below -370 degrees Fahrenheit (-223 degrees Celsius) to detect faint infrared signals.</p><p>The JWST is expected to operate for at least five years, with a goal of 10 years. It will revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and reveal new insights into our origins and destiny.</p><h2>Webb telescope's mission: A new window into space</h2><p>The JWST is a joint project of NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency.

It involves many technical challenges and risks, such as launching a large telescope on a single rocket, unfolding it in space like origami, and operating it in a harsh environment far from Earth.</p><p>The JWST was originally planned to launch in 2007, but faced multiple delays and cost overruns due to technical issues, design changes, testing failures, management problems and budget constraints. The final launch date was Dec. 25, 2021, after NASA completed an independent review of the project's readiness and resolved some last-minute glitches.</p><p>The JWST launched on an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana on the northeastern coast of South America. ESA (European Space Agency) provided the Ariane 5. The rocket placed the telescope into an elliptical orbit around Earth, from where it performed several maneuvers to reach its final destination at Lagrange point 2 (L2), a stable spot about 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth where the telescope can observe both Earth and space without interference from sunlight.</p><p>The JWST underwent six months of commissioning before it began its scientific mission. Commissioning involved testing and calibrating all aspects of the telescope's performance, such as its optics, instruments, communications, thermal control and pointing stability. Commissioning also involved deploying several key components of the telescope in space, such as its primary mirror, secondary mirror, sunshield and solar array.</p><p>The deployment sequence was one of the most critical and risky phases of the mission, as it involved unfolding and aligning 344 separate parts with precise timing and coordination. Any failure or anomaly could have jeopardized the entire mission. Fortunately, all deployments were successfully completed by Jan. 29, 2022.</p><p>The JWST entered its science operations phase on Feb. 25, 2022. It started delivering its first images and data in June 2022. The first images revealed stunning views of star-forming regions in our galaxy, distant galaxies in the early universe, and a rare comet in the asteroid belt.</p><p>The JWST is expected to make groundbreaking discoveries in all fields of astronomy, from planetary science to cosmology. Some of its main science goals are:</p><ul><li>To study how galaxies formed and evolved over cosmic time</li><li>To observe how stars are born and how planetary systems form</li><li>To characterize the atmospheres and climates of exoplanets</li><li>To investigate the physical conditions of dark matter and dark energy</li><li>To explore the origins of life in our solar system and beyond</li></ul><h6>Webb telescope, water vapor, rare comet, main belt comet, solar system, infrared observatory, space science mission</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
