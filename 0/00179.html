He underwent surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation, but his cancer relapsed twice and became resistant to conventional treatments. His doctors told his mother that he had only a few months to live and advised her to prepare for his funeral.</p><p>But Chien-en did not give up hope. He told his mother, "Believe me, I will live on!" He enrolled in a clinical trial of a new immunotherapy drug called GD2 antibody, which targets a specific molecule on the surface of neuroblastoma cells and activates the body's immune system to fight the cancer. He received the drug intravenously every three weeks for a year, along with other supportive medications.</p><p>The results were remarkable. Chien-en's cancer gradually shrank and disappeared, and he has been in remission for more than six years. He is now 13 years old and in sixth grade. He loves trains, diving, environmental protection, and picking up trash from the sea floor. He is also an idol and role model for other children in the hospital ward.</p><h2>The science behind GD2 antibody</h2><p>GD2 antibody is a type of monoclonal antibody, which is a laboratory-made protein that can bind to specific targets on cancer cells. GD2 is a molecule that is highly expressed on neuroblastoma cells, but not on normal cells. By attaching to GD2, the antibody can flag the cancer cells for destruction by the immune system, while sparing healthy cells.</p><p>GD2 antibody was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in children who have completed other therapies. It is also available in some European countries and Taiwan under compassionate use programs or clinical trials. However, it is not widely accessible or affordable in many parts of the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries where most cases of neuroblastoma occur.</p><p>GD2 antibody is not a cure-all for neuroblastoma. It can cause serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, pain, fever, low blood pressure, and nerve damage. It also does not work for everyone, and some patients may relapse or develop resistance to the drug. Therefore, more research is needed to improve the safety and efficacy of GD2 antibody and to find other ways to prevent and treat neuroblastoma.</p><h2>The hope for the future</h2><p>Chien-en's story is an inspiring example of how a new immunotherapy drug can make a difference in the lives of children with cancer. His mother said, "I am very grateful to the doctors and nurses who took care of him, and to the researchers who developed this drug. They gave him a second chance at life."</p><p>Chien-en said he wants to grow up and become a train driver or a diver. He also wants to help other children with cancer and raise awareness about the disease. He said, "I hope that more people will know about neuroblastoma and support the research for better treatments. I also hope that more children with cancer can receive GD2 antibody and have a chance to survive like me."</p><h6>Chien-en, neuroblastoma, GD2 antibody, immunotherapy, cancer</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
