Police wrestled a suspect to the ground as screaming bystanders scrambled to get away and smoke filled the air. A police officer suffered minor injuries in the incident, according to local media reports.</p><p>The explosion occurred just before Kishida was to begin his speech at Saikazaki port in Wakayama prefecture, where he was supporting his ruling party's candidate in a local election. TV footage showed Kishida standing with his back to the crowd when his security detail suddenly pointed to the ground near him. The prime minister turned around, looking alarmed, as the camera quickly shifted to the crowd.</p><p>A young man wearing a white surgical mask and holding what appeared to be another device, a long silver tube, was tackled by several people, including uniformed and plainclothes police officers. As they tried to remove the tube from his hands, a much larger explosion was heard near where Kishida had been standing. The crowd dispersed in panic as police dragged the man away.</p><p>It was not immediately clear what the explosive device was or how many the suspect had, but some reports said it was a smoke or pipe bomb, possibly with a delayed fuse. The motive and background of the suspect were also unknown, as police were still investigating.</p><h2>How did Kishida react?</h2><p>Kishida resumed his campaign speeches later that day, saying he was sorry for causing concern and that he was safe and unharmed. He also condemned the violence and said that elections were the core of democracy and should not be threatened or obstructed.</p><p>"Police are investigating the details of the loud explosive sound at the previous speech venue," Kishida said. "I am sorry for causing many people to be concerned. We are in the middle of an important election for our country. We must carry this on together."</p><p>Kishida became prime minister in October 2023 after winning a leadership contest within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for most of the past six decades. He faces a general election by November 2023, when his term as LDP leader expires.</p><h2>How did others respond?</h2><p>The incident came on the eve of a major international forum in Japan, where Kishida is expected to host leaders from Australia, India and the United States for a summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), a strategic alliance seen as a counterweight to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that Kishida's schedule would not be affected by the incident and that he would attend the Quad summit as planned on Sunday.</p><p>Matsuno also expressed gratitude to the police and security personnel who protected Kishida and said that Japan would never tolerate threats or obstruction by violence.</p><p>The chaotic scene was reminiscent of the assassination nine months ago of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was stabbed to death by a man during a campaign tour in Hokkaido. Abe's killing shocked Japan and raised questions about its political stability and security.</p><h6>Japan, Fumio Kishida, explosion, Wakayama</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
