Until now, only surgical abortion was available in Japan through two methods: the curettage method, which removes tissue inside the uterus with a metal instrument, and the evacuation method, which sucks out tissue through a tube. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described curettage as an "obsolete" method that is less safe and much more painful, and has called for it to be replaced by the evacuation method or by medication like abortion pills.</p><p>Abortion pills consist of two types of pill: mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone that is necessary to continue a pregnancy. Misoprostol, taken 36 to 48 hours after the first drug, induces contractions. The WHO has included this medication in its Essential Medicines List, described as safe and effective for pregnant people.</p><p>Mifepristone was first approved in France in 1988, and in the US in 2000. The medication is available in 25 countries including Canada, Latin America, Asia and Australia, according to British pharmaceutical Linepharma, which manufactures the MeFeego Pack, an abortion pill that combines mifepristone and misoprostol.</p><h2>Approval Process and Public Opinion</h2><p>A panel for Japan's health ministry agreed on Friday to approve the MeFeego Pack for women who have been pregnant for nine weeks or less. The ministry had first convened in January to review the drug, before asking for the public to submit their opinions through an online portal. It will now go to the health minister for final approval.</p><p>The approval was supported by public comments and petitions from medical experts and activists who have been pushing for years for access to abortion pills in Japan. They argued that the medication would provide women with more options and autonomy over their own bodies, as well as reduce the physical and psychological risks associated with surgical abortion.</p><p>However, some conservative groups opposed the approval of the drug, claiming that it would encourage irresponsible sexual behavior and increase abortions. They also raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of the medication, as well as the potential side effects such as bleeding, infection and incomplete abortion.</p><h2>Limitations and Challenges</h2><p>The use of the abortion pill in Japan will be limited to places where patients can be hospitalized until sufficient data is collected to evaluate appropriate care, according to the health ministry. The drugmaker and medical institutions will be required to report sales and usage data to local medical associations.</p><p>Moreover, Japan's abortion laws still impose restrictions on women's reproductive rights. For instance, abortions require a husband's consent when a woman is married, except in cases of rape. This denies women the right to make decisions on their own body, especially in situations where they face domestic violence or coercion from their partners.</p><p>Additionally, oral contraceptives are not covered by insurance in Japan, making them less affordable and accessible for many women. Epidural anesthesia during delivery is also available only at select hospitals, limiting women's choices during childbirth.</p><h2>Implications and Future Prospects</h2><p>The approval of the abortion pill in Japan is a significant milestone for reproductive rights in the country, as it gives women a safer and less invasive alternative to end unwanted pregnancies. It also reflects a growing awareness and demand for more reproductive health measures among Japanese society.</p><p>However, there are still many challenges and barriers that need to be overcome to ensure that women have full access to reproductive health care and autonomy in Japan. These include revising the abortion laws, expanding insurance coverage for contraceptives, increasing availability of epidural anesthesia during delivery, and improving sex education and awareness about contraceptive methods.</p><p>The approval of the abortion pill also comes at a time when abortion and reproductive rights have gained revived attention worldwide, with the US Supreme Court reversing overturned Roe v. Wade last year – ruling that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion . Since then, a number of states have restricted access to abortions, while others moved to increase access.</p><h6>Japan, Abortion Pill, Reproductive Rights</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
