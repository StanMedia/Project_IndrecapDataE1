The heat wave has affected at least a dozen countries, from India to China to Thailand, with some areas seeing temperatures as high as 45.4°C (113.7°F) - the highest ever recorded in Thailand's history.</p><p>According to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera, using data from various meteorological departments, Laos is the latest country to set a new all-time record as Luang Prabang reached 42.7°C (109°F) on Tuesday. Myanmar also set an April temperature record on Monday as Kalewa, in central Sagaing region, reached 44°C (111°F). China saw temperatures as high as 42.4°C (108°F) in Yuanyang, in the southeast - only 0.3°C from the country-wide record for April. On Monday, more than 100 weather stations in 12 provinces broke their April temperature record.</p><p>India and Bangladesh have also been sweltering under the heat, with numerous locations exceeding 40°C (104°F). On Monday, Prayagraj in India reached 44.6°C (112.3°F). Herrera warned that "it will just get worse" as the peak of the hot season is still ahead.</p><p>April and May are typically the hottest months of the year for South and Southeast Asia as temperatures rise before monsoon rains bring some relief. However, this year's heat wave has set in unusually early and has been compounded by other factors such as air pollution, drought and forest fires.</p><p>Herrera called this event the "worst heat wave in Asian history" given its footprint, severity and timing.</p><h2>Heat wave impacts human health and economy</h2><p>The extreme heat has not only been uncomfortable but also deadly for many people in Asia. In India, at least 13 people died of heat stroke on Sunday while attending a government-sponsored event honoring a revered social worker from Maharashtra. The ceremony was held outdoors, with tens of thousands of people packed close together.</p><p>Heat stroke is a serious condition that occurs when the body's temperature rises above 40°C (104°F) and cannot cool down. It can cause organ damage, seizures, coma and death if not treated promptly. Heat stroke is more likely to affect older people, children, people with chronic diseases and people who work or exercise outdoors.</p><p>The heat wave can also have significant economic impacts by reducing productivity, disrupting agriculture and increasing energy demand. For example, heat waves can curtail daily activities and reduce economic output, from limiting outdoor construction work to closing schools that lack air conditioning. In Thailand, the heat has been worsened by an intense smoggy season that has caused pollution levels to spike. The tourist hotspot of Chiang Mai in the north ranked as the world's most polluted city for seven straight days as smoke from forest fires and widespread crop burning deteriorated the air quality. At least one hospital in the city said it had reached "full ward capacity" as patients sought medical treatment for respiratory issues.</p><p>The heat wave can also affect food security by damaging crops and livestock. According to Reuters, farmers in northern India are struggling to cope with the heat and water scarcity that have affected their wheat harvest. Some farmers have reported losses of up to 40% due to shriveled grains and low yields. In China, authorities have warned of possible power shortages as demand for electricity surges amid the heat wave.</p><h2>Heat wave linked to climate change</h2><p>The link between more frequent and severe heat waves and human-caused climate change is firmly established, as formerly low probability, high-impact events occur more frequently. According to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), every increment of additional warming will worsen climate change effects, including heat waves.</p><p>Studies show that this part of the world is especially vulnerable to the impacts of extreme heat. China and India alone are home to one third of the world's population. A study published in Nature Climate Change in 2017 projected that by 2100, up to 75% of people in Asia could face deadly heat waves every year if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.</p><p>Another study published in Science Advances in 2018 found that some parts of South Asia could become uninhabitable by the end of this century due to extreme heat and humidity. The study warned that millions of people could be exposed to potentially fatal conditions that exceed the human body's ability to cope with heat stress.</p><h2>Heat wave calls for urgent adaptation and mitigation actions</h2><p>The current heat wave in Asia highlights the urgent need for adaptation and mitigation actions to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of people and ecosystems to climate change. Adaptation refers to the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change and its effects, while mitigation refers to the actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance carbon sinks.</p><p>Adaptation strategies can help reduce the negative impacts of heat waves and enhance the resilience of communities and sectors. For example, some adaptation measures include:</p><ul><li>Developing and implementing heat action plans that provide early warning systems, public awareness campaigns, cooling centers, emergency medical services and other interventions to protect human health.</li><li>Improving urban planning and design to reduce the urban heat island effect, which occurs when cities are warmer than their surroundings due to human activities and infrastructure. This can be done by increasing green spaces, shading, ventilation, reflective surfaces and water features.</li><li>Promoting water conservation and management to cope with drought and water scarcity, which can exacerbate heat stress and affect agriculture, energy and health. This can be done by improving irrigation efficiency, rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, water recycling and allocation.</li><li>Supporting climate-smart agriculture and livelihoods that can adapt to changing temperature and precipitation patterns, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance food security. This can be done by promoting crop diversification, agroforestry, soil conservation, organic farming and other practices.</li></ul><p>Mitigation strategies can help limit the magnitude and rate of global warming and thus reduce the frequency and intensity of future heat waves. For example, some mitigation measures include:</p><ul><li>Transitioning to low-carbon energy sources that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and provide clean and reliable electricity for cooling and other needs. This can be done by expanding renewable energy generation, storage and transmission, improving energy efficiency and conservation, phasing out coal-fired power plants and other actions.</li><li>Enhancing natural carbon sinks that can sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide co-benefits for biodiversity, water quality and soil health. This can be done by restoring forests, wetlands, grasslands and other ecosystems, reducing deforestation and degradation, promoting afforestation and reforestation and other actions.</li><li>Implementing carbon pricing and trading schemes that can create incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generate revenues for climate action. This can be done by establishing carbon taxes, cap-and-trade systems, emission reduction credits and other mechanisms.</li></ul><p>Asia is well positioned to address these challenges and capture the opportunities that come from managing climate risk effectively. Infrastructure and urban areas are still being built out in many parts of Asia, which gives the region a chance to ensure that what goes up is more resilient and better able to withstand heightened risk. At the same time, key economies in the region, such as China and Japan, are leading the world in technologies, from electric vehicles to renewable energy, that are necessary to adapt to and mitigate climate change.</p><h6>Asia, heat wave, climate change, adaptation, mitigation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
