The metallic object crashed through the roof of a house and ricocheted around a bedroom. No one was in the bedroom at the time of the incident, and no injuries were reported.</p><p>Police are still working to determine the precise nature of the object, though officials suspect it is related to the current meteor shower, called the Eta Aquariids, according to a statement from the Hopewell Township Police Department in New Jersey.</p><p>The Eta Aquariid meteor shower is an annual phenomenon in which debris from the famous Halley's Comet rains down into Earth's atmosphere. The celestial event was expected to peak this past Saturday, according to American Meteor Society predictions, though it will last through May 27.</p><p>"I did touch the thing because I just thought it was a random rock," Suzy Kop, a local resident who said the rock fell through the roof of her father's bedroom, told CNN affiliate KYW-TV in Philadelphia. "And it was warm."</p><p>"I just thank God that my father was not here. No one was here," she added. "You know, we weren't hurt or anything."</p><p>The outermost part of meteorites can reach scorching temperatures because of the incredible friction and pressure involved with plunging into the Earth's thick atmosphere at high speeds, though they typically cool off significantly as they reach the ground.</p><h2>Meteorite strikes are rare but not unheard of</h2><p>Space rocks strike all the time, distributed evenly across the Earth's surface. But striking a home or populated area is rare because the majority of our planet is covered in oceans or undeveloped areas.</p><p>A meteorite strike is not, however, unheard of. In November 2023, for example, an object believed to be a meteorite from the Taurid meteor shower struck a house in Northern California, according to CNN affiliate KCRA in Sacramento. A fire broke out soon after. The Nevada County resident, Dustin Procita, was at home with his two dogs at the time of the incident. One of the dogs died in the fire.</p><p>Authorities in New Jersey said the possible meteorite that struck on Monday measured about 4 inches by 6 inches. "It penetrated the roof, the ceiling and then impacted the hardwood floor before coming to a rest," police said.</p><p>The police department "has contacted several other agencies for assistance in positively identifying the object and safeguarding the residents and the object."</p><p>Meteorites can be difficult to distinguish from other types of metallic rocks. Researchers who hunt for meteorites typically look for fusion crust, a glassy coating that forms on the cosmic object's exterior surface, which melts while the rock plummets through the Earth's atmosphere.</p><h2>What are meteor showers and why do they happen?</h2><p>Meteor showers are caused by streams of cosmic debris entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories.</p><p>Most are fragments from comets or asteroids, while others are collision impact debris ejected from bodies such as the Moon or Mars.</p><p>When comets come around the Sun, they leave a dusty trail behind them. Every year Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows some of these bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colorful streaks in the sky.</p><p>The Eta Aquariids originate from Halley's Comet, which takes about 76 years to orbit around the Sun. The last time Halley's Comet was visible from Earth was in 1986 and it won't be visible again until 2061.</p><p>The Eta Aquariids are best viewed in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. According to NASA, skywatchers should find an area away from city lights and lie flat on their back with their feet facing east. They should look up and take in as much sky as possible.</p><h2>What is fusion crust and how does it form?</h2><p>Fusion crust is a thin melted surface layer of thermally transformed components of a meteorite. It forms when a meteorite falls through the Earth’s atmosphere and experiences intense heat and pressure. It is often black and looks like an eggshell coating the rock. However, this crust weathers to a rusty brown color after several years of exposure on the Earth’s surface and will eventually disappear altogether.</p><p>Fusion crust is mainly composed of olivine, glass, wuestite and other iron oxides of the magnetite series and rarely exceeds a thickness of 1 mm. It can help identify a meteorite from a plain old Earth rock, as most meteorites have some fusion crust on their surface. However, fusion crust can also be eroded by wind or water, or altered by chemical reactions over time.</p><p>Fusion crust can also provide clues about the origin and history of a meteorite. For example, some fusion crusts show evidence of ablation, which is the loss of material due to heating and melting during atmospheric entry. Ablation can create pits, grooves, or flow lines on the surface of a meteorite. Some fusion crusts also show signs of shock metamorphism, which is the change in mineral structure due to high pressure and temperature. Shock metamorphism can produce fractures, veins, or melt pockets in the meteorite.</p><h6>New Jersey, meteorite, Eta Aquariid</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
