Movie</h1><p><img src=https://a1.indrecap.com/0/00049.webp height=281 class=antiCLS /></p><p class=imgCredit>Photo by Pixabay</p><p>The Japanese video game giant has decided to change the name of Foreman Spike, a villainous character who appears in the blockbuster film adaptation of its popular franchise.</p><h2>The name change</h2><p>Nintendo announced last week that it has changed the Japanese name of Foreman Spike, a character who appears in "The Super Mario Bros. Movie", which is set to be released in Japan on April 28, 2023. The character, who first appeared as an enemy of Mario in the 1980s game "Wrecking Crew", will be renamed from "Blackie" to "Spike" in Japanese, just as he has been known to Western fans for the past three decades.</p><p>The company did not provide a clear reason for the decision to change the name, which could be read as a racist slur, saying only that the new Japanese name will be the same as the name used in Europe and the United States. "The name in 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie', which will be released on April 28, 2023, will be 'Spike' as well," the company said in a tweet posted to its official Japanese Twitter account on April 20, 2023.</p><p>CNN has reached out to Nintendo for comment, but has not received a response as of this writing.</p><h2>The character and the movie</h2><p>Foreman Spike originally debuted in the 1985 Wrecking Crew series as a construction worker and arch-rival of Mario. He made the jump to the big screen in this year's "Super Mario Bros. Movie", in which he appears as the former boss of Mario and his brother Luigi before they quit their construction jobs to start their own plumbing business.</p><p>The movie, which is based on Nintendo's iconic video game franchise that features the adventures of Mario and Luigi in a fantasy world filled with colorful characters and enemies, has been a huge success at the box office. It made more than US$200 million in the US and Canada for its five-day opening run, according to a news release from Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment, and an estimated US$377 million worldwide as of April 23, 2023.</p><p>The movie stars Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek, Sebastian Maniscalco as Spike (formerly Blackie), and Charles Martinet as various voices.</p><p>The movie follows Brooklyn plumbers Mario and Luigi as they are transported down a mysterious pipe while working underground to fix a water main. The brothers wander into a "magical new world" and when they are separated, "Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi", according to a synopsis on the movie's website.</p><h2>The reaction and the context</h2><p>The name change of Foreman Spike has sparked mixed reactions from fans and critics online. Some praised Nintendo for being sensitive and respectful to different cultures and audiences, while others questioned why it took so long for the company to make the change or whether it was necessary at all.</p><p>Some also pointed out that Foreman Spike is not the only character in Nintendo's history that has had a controversial or offensive name. For example, Mr. Game &amp; Watch, a character who represents Nintendo's early handheld games, was criticized for having a feather on his head and performing a fire attack that resembled a Native American stereotype in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Nintendo later apologized and removed the feather from his design.</p><p>Another example is Jynx, a Pokemon that resembles a human woman with black skin, blonde hair, and large lips. Jynx was accused of being a racist caricature of black people and was edited to have purple skin instead of black in later versions of Pokemon games and anime.</p><p>Nintendo is not the only video game company that has faced backlash for its character names or designs. In recent years, several video game developers have changed or removed elements from their games that were deemed insensitive or inappropriate by some groups or regions. For instance, Blizzard Entertainment changed the name of one of its Overwatch characters from McCree to Cole Cassidy after it was revealed that the original name was based on a former employee who was accused of sexual harassment. Similarly, Sony Interactive Entertainment changed the design of one of its Demon's Souls characters from an Asian man with stereotypical features to a more realistic one after receiving criticism from Chinese players.</p><p>These examples show that the video game industry is constantly evolving and adapting to the changing expectations and demands of its diverse and global audience. As such, video game companies may face challenges and controversies when it comes to naming or designing their characters, especially when they cross cultural or linguistic boundaries.</p><p>Nintendo, as one of the oldest and most influential video game companies in the world, has shown that it is willing to make changes to its characters when necessary, even if it means altering a part of its history or legacy. Whether this is a sign of respect or a bow to pressure, it remains to be seen how Nintendo and other video game companies will handle similar issues in the future.</p><h6>Nintendo, Super Mario Bros.
