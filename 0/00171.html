It is especially dangerous for patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and intensive care units, who may have weakened immune systems or invasive devices such as ventilators and catheters.</p><p>The bacteria can survive for long periods on surfaces and equipment, and can spread easily through contact with contaminated hands or objects. It also has the ability to acquire resistance to many antibiotics, making it difficult to treat. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified it as a "critical" threat among its "priority pathogens" – a group of bacteria families that pose the "greatest threat" to human health.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 8,500 cases of Acinetobacter baumannii infections occur each year in the United States, and about 700 of them result in death. Globally, the mortality rate of these infections can reach up to 50%.</p><h2>The discovery of a new antibiotic</h2><p>In a new study published on Thursday in the science journal Nature Chemical Biology, a group of scientists from McMaster University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have reported the discovery of a new antibiotic that can kill Acinetobacter baumannii. The antibiotic, named abaucin, was identified using artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>The researchers used an AI algorithm to screen thousands of antibacterial molecules in an attempt to predict new structural classes. The algorithm was trained on data from previous experiments that tested the ability of different chemicals to kill various bacteria. The algorithm then analyzed 6,680 compounds that it had not encountered before, and selected 240 of them as potential antibiotics.</p><p>The researchers tested these compounds in the laboratory against 41 different strains of Acinetobacter baumannii that were resistant to multiple antibiotics. They found that abaucin was effective against all of them, and had a low risk of inducing resistance. They also tested abaucin on the skin of mice that were infected with Acinetobacter baumannii, and found that it controlled the growth of the bacteria.</p><h2>The mechanism of action</h2><p>The researchers also investigated how abaucin works against Acinetobacter baumannii. They found that abaucin targets a protein called BamA, which is essential for the bacteria to build and maintain their outer membrane. The outer membrane protects the bacteria from environmental stress and immune responses, and also helps them resist many antibiotics.</p><p>By binding to BamA, abaucin disrupts the outer membrane and causes the bacteria to leak and die. The researchers also found that abaucin does not affect other types of bacteria that do not have BamA, such as those that live in the gut or on the skin. This means that abaucin is a rare example of a narrowly targeted antibiotic, which could prevent collateral damage to beneficial bacteria and reduce the risk of resistance development.</p><h2>The implications and limitations</h2><p>The researchers said that their study demonstrates the potential of using AI to discover new antibiotics that can fight drug-resistant bacteria. They said that AI can speed up the process of screening and selecting promising compounds, and also help identify novel mechanisms of action.</p><p>However, they also acknowledged some limitations and challenges. They said that abaucin still needs to be further refined and tested in human clinical trials before it can be used in patients. They also said that abaucin may not be effective against other types of drug-resistant bacteria that have different outer membrane structures or mechanisms.</p><p>They also cautioned that AI alone cannot solve the problem of antibiotic resistance, which requires a multifaceted approach involving infection prevention and control measures, appropriate use and stewardship of existing antibiotics, and continuous research and development of new antibiotics.</p><h6>AI, antibiotic, superbug</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
