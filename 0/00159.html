Security eventually had to physically remove activists one by one from the conference center.</p><p>A video posted by Follow This, an activist investor group, showed a cluster of attendees standing up and singing "Go to hell, Shell, and don't you come back no more" to the tune of Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles.</p><p>The demonstrations delayed the meeting by more than an hour, according to a Shell spokesperson.</p><p>"We respect people's right to express their point of view and welcome any constructive engagement on our strategy and the energy transition. However, yet again protesters have shown that they are not interested in constructive engagement," the spokesperson said in a statement.</p><h2>What did the protesters want from Shell?</h2><p>The protesters were part of various campaign groups that are looking to ramp up the pressure on Shell and other energy companies to align their climate targets with the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>They also wanted Shell to commit to absolute carbon emissions cuts by 2030 and focus more resources towards renewables.</p><p>One of the groups behind the protests was Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), which also organized a walkout at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle on Monday over similar issues.</p><p>"Shell is one of the biggest polluters in the world and we are here to say enough is enough. We demand that Shell stops extracting fossil fuels, stops funding climate denial and stops greenwashing its image," said Laura Hillis, a spokesperson for AECJ.</p><p>Another group was Fossil Free London, which staged a demonstration outside the venue with banners and placards reading "Shell kills" and "Shell out of London".</p><p>"We are here to show solidarity with communities around the world who are suffering from Shell's operations. Shell is not only destroying the climate but also violating human rights and causing environmental devastation," said Jerry Tang, a spokesperson for Fossil Free London.</p><h2>How did Shell's shareholders react?</h2><p>Shell's shareholders also expressed their dissatisfaction with the company's climate strategy at the meeting.</p><p>Several shareholders voted against the re-election of all of Shell's directors, saying they were not doing enough to deliver on their climate targets.</p><p>Some shareholders also supported a resolution filed by Follow This, which called on Shell to set more ambitious emissions reduction goals that are aligned with the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The resolution received 30% of votes in favor, up from 14% last year, indicating growing investor pressure on Shell to take more action on climate change.</p><p>Shell had asked its shareholders to reject the resolution, saying it was already committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and reducing its carbon intensity by 20% by 2030.</p><p>However, some shareholders said these targets were not sufficient or credible, as they relied on offsets and intensity measures rather than absolute cuts.</p><p>"We are disappointed that Shell has not taken our resolution seriously. We believe that Shell needs to set clear and concrete targets for reducing its emissions across its entire value chain, not just its own operations," said Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This.</p><h6>Shell, climate protests, shareholder meeting, emissions targets, Follow This</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
