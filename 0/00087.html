On Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, users called for other local governments to follow suit.</p><h2>China's pandemic surveillance</h2><p>China collects vast amounts of data on its citizens – from gathering their DNA and other biological samples to tracking their movements on a sprawling network of surveillance cameras and monitoring their digital footprints.</p><p>But since the pandemic, state surveillance has pushed deeper into the private lives of Chinese citizens, resulting in unprecedented levels of data collection.</p><p>During the pandemic, Covid apps dictated social and economic life across China, controlling whether people could leave their homes, where they could travel, when businesses could open and where goods could be transported.</p><p>But following the country's abrupt exit from zero-Covid in December, most of these apps faded from daily life. On December 12, China scrapped a nationwide mobile tracking app that collected data on users' travel movements.</p><p>However, many local pandemic apps run by the municipal or provincial governments, such as the ubiquitous Covid health code apps, have remained in place – although they are no longer in use.</p><h2>Privacy concerns</h2><p>Following the dismantling of zero-Covid restrictions, residents have grown concerned over the security of the huge amount of personal data stored by local governments, fearing potential data leaks or theft.</p><p>Last July, it was revealed that a massive online database apparently containing the personal information of up to one billion Chinese citizens was left unsecured and publicly accessible for more than a year – until an anonymous user in a hack forum offered to sell the data and brought it to wider attention.</p><p>In the statement, Wuxi officials said "third-party audit and notary officers" would be invited to take part in the deletion process, to ensure it cannot be restored. CNN cannot independently verify the destruction of the data.</p><p>Wuxi also scrapped more than 40 local apps used for "digital epidemic prevention," according to the statement.</p><h2>Implications for civil rights</h2><p>The deletion of Covid-related personal data by Wuxi may signal a shift in China's approach to pandemic surveillance, as the country adapts to living with endemic Covid-19.</p><p>Some analysts have argued that China's extensive use of digital tools for epidemic control has eroded civil rights and privacy protections for its citizens.</p><p>In a report published in January by Human Rights Watch (HRW), the organization said China's Covid-19 response had "exacerbated longstanding human rights violations."</p><p>"China has ramped up its repression of activists and journalists amid Covid-19," said Sophie Richardson, HRW's China director. "The authorities have used Covid-19 as a pretext to expand mass surveillance."</p><p>It remains unclear whether other Chinese cities will follow Wuxi's example and delete their Covid-related personal data. The central government has not issued any official guidelines on how to handle such data after the pandemic.</p><h2>China's surveillance challenges</h2><p>Despite its technological prowess and vast resources, China still faces some challenges in implementing its surveillance system. Some of the difficulties include the lack of data protection laws, the low quality of some data sources, the resistance from some segments of society, and the potential backlash from the international community.</p><p>China does not have a comprehensive data protection law that regulates how personal data can be collected, stored, used and shared. This means that citizens have little recourse to challenge the authorities' use of their data or to seek redress for any misuse or abuse. It also means that there is a risk of data breaches or leaks that could expose sensitive information to hackers or foreign adversaries.</p><p>Some of the data sources that China relies on for its surveillance system are not very reliable or accurate. For example, some facial recognition cameras have been found to misidentify people based on their ethnicity, gender or age. Some phone trackers have been found to be easily hacked or spoofed. Some DNA databases have been found to contain errors or contamination. These flaws could undermine the effectiveness and legitimacy of the surveillance system.</p><p>Some segments of society have resisted or opposed China's surveillance system, either openly or covertly. For example, some activists and dissidents have used encryption, VPNs, masks or other methods to evade or disrupt the surveillance. Some ethnic minorities, such as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, have suffered from severe human rights violations as a result of the surveillance. Some ordinary citizens have expressed discontent or distrust over the surveillance, especially when it infringes on their privacy or dignity.</p><p>China's surveillance system has also attracted criticism and condemnation from the international community, especially from Western countries and human rights organizations. They have accused China of violating civil liberties, human rights and democratic norms with its surveillance. They have also expressed concern over China's export of its surveillance technology and model to other authoritarian regimes around the world. They have called for more scrutiny and regulation of China's surveillance activities and practices.</p><h6>Wuxi, China, Covid-19, personal data, privacy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
