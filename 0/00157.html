Workers participating have two main demands: asking the e-commerce giant to put climate impact at the forefront of its decision making, and to provide greater flexibility for how and where employees work.</p><p>The lunchtime walkout is scheduled for May 31, beginning at noon. Organizers have said in an internal pledge that they are only going to go through with the walkout if at least 1,000 workers agree to participate, according to an email from organizers.</p><p>The collective action from corporate workers comes after Amazon, like other Big Tech companies, cut tens of thousands of jobs beginning late last year amid broader economic uncertainty. All told, Amazon has said this year that it is laying off some 27,000 workers in multiple rounds of cuts.</p><p>At the same time, Amazon and other tech companies are trying to get workers into the office more. In February, Amazon said it was requiring thousands of its workers to be in the office for at least three days per week, starting on May 1.</p><p>"Morale is really at an all-time low right now," an Amazon corporate worker based in Los Angeles, who plans on participating in the walkout next week, told CNN. "I think the hope from this walkout is really to send a clear message to leadership that we're expecting real action from them on a number of issues, with the thesis of just, like, we need better long term decision-making that benefits not only employees but the communities that we serve."</p><h2>How has Amazon responded?</h2><p>Amazon has defended its decisions and actions regarding layoffs, return-to-office policies and climate change.</p><p>The company said the layoffs were part of a regular process of evaluating its businesses and teams and making adjustments as needed. It also said it was hiring for more than 55,000 open positions across its corporate offices and tech hubs.</p><p>The company said the return-to-office policies were based on feedback from employees who wanted more collaboration and connection with their colleagues. It also said it was offering flexible work options for some roles and teams.</p><p>The company said it was committed to addressing climate change and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. It also said it was investing in renewable energy projects, electric vehicles and circular economy initiatives.</p><p>"We value our employees' input and feedback," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. "We are proud of our culture of direct dialogue with employees across all levels of our organization."</p><h2>What are the implications for Amazon?</h2><p>Amazon is not the only tech company that is facing employee backlash over layoffs and return-to-office policies. Google, Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft and others have also experienced protests, petitions and resignations from workers who are unhappy with their employers' decisions and actions.</p><p>These companies are also competing with each other for talent and customers in a rapidly changing and competitive industry. Therefore, Amazon faces both challenges and opportunities in dealing with its employee discontent.</p><p>On one hand, it needs to address the concerns and grievances of its workers who are essential for its innovation and growth. On the other hand, it has the potential to leverage its scale and resources to create positive impacts for its workers, customers and society at large.</p><h6>Amazon, walkout, layoffs, return-to-office, climate change</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
