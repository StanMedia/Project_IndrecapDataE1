At another counter of the studio, one carefully straightens her hair. Together, they cram into a photo booth, pose, and then marvel at the photo strips the machine drops below. They tape one onto a wall filled with images of other young patrons.</p><p>It’s a familiar scene playing out at several hundred small photo studios that have recently opened in Seoul. The spaces — with no staff visibly present — typically house three to six booths and are open 24 hours a day. Since the pandemic, the studios have become one of the trendiest destinations among South Korean Gen Z.</p><p>On the main thoroughfare of Hongdae, the city’s busiest district, they’re found on every block — sometimes, only a few feet apart.</p><p>20-year-old university student Choi Hui-je told CNN he visits a studio every time he goes out with friends, which is around five to seven times a month. Once, he recalled in a phone interview, he went five times in one week.</p><p>"It’s a necessary stop. We go for food, karaoke, café, and then the photo studio," Choi said.</p><p>19-year-old Jenny Dall’alba, a student in the southern city of Busan, estimates she’s gone more than 70 times over the past few years.</p><p>"This is not a fad but a must-go-to every time," she said.</p><h2>A blast from the past</h2><p>Many around the world may have their own memories of hopping into similar booths. In the early 2000s, they surged in popularity thanks to the development of digital technology and coveted sticker versions. But two decades later, in the age of social media and post-pandemic, they’ve taken on a whole new life in South Korea.</p><p>Studios differentiate from one another by themes, which is reflected by storefronts, interiors, as well as the appearance of the printed strips themselves. Some offer retro vibes with neon lights and cassette tapes, while others go for cute and colorful aesthetics with animal props and floral backgrounds.</p><p>With over 245 locations in the Seoul Metropolitan area and 200 more around the country, Life4Cuts has a major share of the market: the brand estimates 2 million people visit their studios every month. On Instagram there are more than 1.1 million posts with the hashtag Life4Cuts (in Korean) — with everyone from K-pop stars to influencers posting the outcome of their shoots.</p><p>Some are seen copying poses from viral TikTok videos or mimicking anime characters’ famous moves. Choi himself likes to channel the expressive memes of pink beaver character Zanmang Loopy from the 2003 South Korean animation Pororo the Little Penguin.</p><p>Dall’alba, who keeps all her photos together in a pouch, says she enjoys getting creative by choosing different props and frames.</p><p>"I like how I can make different versions of myself depending on how I feel that day," she said.</p><h2>A coping mechanism</h2><p>The popularity of photo studios can also be seen as a reflection of how young people are coping with the pandemic and its impact on their lives.</p><p>South Korea has been widely praised for its effective response to Covid-19, but it has also faced several waves of infections that have led to strict social distancing measures and prolonged school closures. Many young people have experienced loneliness, anxiety and depression as they were forced to stay home and limit their interactions with others.</p><p>According to a survey by Seoul National University Hospital last year, 75% of teenagers reported feeling depressed during the pandemic, while 43% said they had suicidal thoughts.</p><p>In this context, photo studios offer a way for young people to escape from reality and find some joy and comfort in their friends and themselves.</p><p>"It’s like a small but guaranteed happiness," Choi said. "Even if I’m having a bad day or feeling stressed about school or work, I can always go to a photo studio and have fun with my friends."</p><p>He added that he feels safer going to a photo studio than other places because there are fewer people and less contact involved.</p><p>Dall’alba agreed that photo studios help her cope with the pandemic blues.</p><p>"I think it’s important to cherish these moments because we don’t know when things will get better," she said. "I want to remember these happy times when I look back at the photos."</p><h2>A cultural phenomenon</h2><p>The photo studio trend is not only a personal hobby but also a cultural phenomenon that reflects the values and preferences of South Korean youth.</p><p>According to Kim Ji-hye, a professor of media and communication at Hanyang University in Seoul, photo studios appeal to young people who are looking for authenticity and individuality in a highly competitive and conformist society.</p><p>"South Korean youth are constantly under pressure to perform well in school, get a good job, and fit in with the mainstream norms," Kim said. "They are also exposed to a lot of curated and filtered images on social media that create unrealistic standards of beauty and success."</p><p>Kim said that photo studios offer a space where young people can express themselves freely and creatively, without worrying about judgment or comparison.</p><p>"They can experiment with different styles, moods and identities, and create their own narratives," Kim said. "They can also share their photos with their friends or online communities that appreciate their uniqueness and diversity."</p><p>Kim added that photo studios also tap into the nostalgia for the pre-digital era, when people used to print out photos and keep them as physical memories.</p><p>"Photo studios are like a bridge between the past and the present, between the analog and the digital," Kim said. "They combine the charm of the old-fashioned photo booths with the convenience and variety of the modern technology."</p><p>Kim predicted that photo studios will continue to be popular among young people even after the pandemic, as they have become part of their culture and lifestyle.</p><p>"They are not just a place to take pictures, but a place to make memories," Kim said.</p><h6>Photo booth, South Korea, Gen Z, pandemic, culture</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
