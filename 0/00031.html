The site had been dormant since 2018, when China began building the station.</p><p>The report, released on Tuesday, said that new support facilities, temporary buildings, a helicopter pad and foundations for a larger main building have appeared at the site in recent months. The station is expected to cover an area of 5,000 square meters (53,820 square feet) and include a scientific research and observation area, an energy facility, a main building, a logistics facility and a wharf for China's Xuelong icebreakers.</p><p>The station is expected to be completed by 2024 and will focus on physical and biological oceanography, glaciology, marine ecology, zoology, atmospheric and space physics and geology, according to a draft Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation submitted by China to an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in 2018.</p><h2>Potential dual-use of facilities raises alarm</h2><p>While China is not the only country that operates research stations in Antarctica, its growing presence and activities in the frozen continent have raised concerns among western governments about its potential dual-use of facilities for military and strategic purposes.</p><p>The CSIS report said that the new station's position on Inexpressible Island could help China "fill in a major gap" in its coverage of Antarctica and support intelligence collection given its inclusion of a satellite ground station. The report said that the station's equipment could be used to intercept satellite communications from US-allied Australia and New Zealand and collect telemetry data on rockets launching from newly established space facilities in both countries.</p><p>The report also said that the station could enhance China's future claims to natural resources and maritime access in Antarctica, as it is located near the Ross Sea, which is rich in fish stocks and has potential oil and gas reserves. The report noted that China has been expanding its fishing activities in the Southern Ocean and has expressed interest in conducting mineral exploration in Antarctica.</p><p>Under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, to which China is party, activities on the continent are restricted to "peaceful purposes". Military personnel are allowed to conduct scientific research, but are banned from setting up bases, carrying out maneuvers or testing weapons. The treaty also freezes any territorial claims and prohibits any exploitation of natural resources until 2048.</p><p>However, a 2022 Pentagon report said that China's new Antarctic infrastructure was probably intended in part to strengthen its future claims to natural resources and maritime access and improve PLA capabilities. The report also said that China could use its civilian research stations as a cover for military activities.</p><h2>China denies any ulterior motives</h2><p>China has denied any ulterior motives behind its Antarctic activities and has maintained that its research stations are purely for scientific purposes. China has also said that it respects the Antarctic Treaty system and abides by its principles and obligations.</p><p>In February 2020, a team of US inspectors visited the new station on Inexpressible Island, where they were hosted by station leader Wang Zhechao of the Polar Research Institute of China. They found no military equipment or military support personnel at the site, according to a report of the inspection published by the United States State Department.</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday that China's construction of the new station was "in line with relevant international rules" and that China was "willing to enhance communication and cooperation with other parties" on Antarctic issues.</p><p>China currently operates four research stations in Antarctica: Changcheng (Great Wall), Zhongshan (Sun Yat-sen), Kunlun and Taishan. The new station on Inexpressible Island will be its fifth and second inland station. China also plans to build another coastal station near Terra Nova Bay in East Antarctica.</p><p>China is not alone in bolstering its presence and research activities in Antarctica, where more than 50 countries have signed the Antarctic Treaty. The US maintains the largest research presence in Antarctica, with three year-round stations (McMurdo, Amundsen-Scott South Pole and Palmer) and several seasonal stations. Other countries such as Britain, Australia, Russia, South Korea and India also operate research stations in Antarctica.</p><h6>China, Antarctica, surveillance, resources</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
