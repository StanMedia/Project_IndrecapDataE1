She had a successful career as a model, actress, author, and television personality. She was also married to John Jenrette, a former Democratic congressman from South Carolina who was involved in the Abscam corruption scandal and resigned in 1980.</p><p>In 1981, she gave a sensational interview to Playboy magazine, in which she revealed that she had sex with her husband on the steps of the US Capitol building. She also posed nude for the magazine and later wrote a memoir titled "My Capitol Secrets".</p><p>In 2009, she married Prince Nicolò Boncompagni Ludovisi, a descendant of one of Rome's oldest and most illustrious aristocratic families. The prince was 97 years old at the time and had three sons from his previous marriages. He died in 2019, leaving behind a complex inheritance dispute over his estate.</p><h2>A historic villa with priceless artworks</h2><p>The estate included the Villa Ludovisi, also known as the Casino dell'Aurora, a 16th-century palazzo in the heart of Rome. The villa is famous for its artistic treasures, such as the only known ceiling painting by Caravaggio, depicting "Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto". The painting was commissioned by Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte, a patron of Caravaggio and Galileo.</p><p>The villa also contains frescoes by other Italian masters such as Guercino and Domenichino, as well as a statue of Pan by Michelangelo that was recently discovered in the garden. The villa was once part of a larger estate that hosted guests such as Goethe, Stendhal, Byron, and Wagner.</p><p>The villa is considered one of the most valuable properties in the world, with an estimated worth of over $500 million. However, it has been neglected and deteriorated over the years, due to lack of funds and maintenance.</p><h2>A bitter feud and a failed auction</h2><p>After the prince's death, his three sons accused Princess Rita of trying to steal their inheritance and failing to preserve the villa. They sued her for damages and demanded that she vacate the property. Princess Rita denied the allegations and claimed that she had invested her own money and time to restore and protect the villa.</p><p>The Italian courts ruled that the villa must be sold to resolve the dispute and that the proceeds must be divided among the four heirs. The villa was put up for auction by the state authorities five times in 2022 and 2023, but no one bid on it. The starting price was set at €471 million ($531 million) in January 2022 and gradually reduced to €180 million ($203 million) in October 2022.</p><p>Princess Rita blamed the state auction house for not advertising the villa properly and for setting unrealistic prices. She also appealed to the Italian government and cultural institutions to intervene and save the villa from being sold to foreign buyers or developers.</p><p>However, her efforts were in vain. In January 2023, a Roman judge ordered her to leave the villa by April 20, citing her failure to maintain the property after a wall collapsed and blocked a nearby street. Princess Rita claimed that the wall was still standing and that she was being unfairly evicted.</p><h2>The end of an era</h2><p>On April 20, 2023, Princess Rita was escorted out of the villa by police officers who also changed the locks. She left with her dogs and some personal belongings, while her other possessions were seized by the authorities. She tweeted that she had been up for 72 hours and that she was being brutally evicted from a home that she had lovingly taken care of for 20 years.</p><p>She also told CNN that she felt betrayed by Italy and that she hoped that someone would buy the villa and preserve its artistic heritage. She said that she would continue to fight for her rights and that she still considered herself a princess.</p><p>The fate of the villa remains uncertain. It is expected to go up for auction again at a later date, but it is unclear whether anyone will be interested or able to afford it. The Caravaggio painting and other artworks are protected by law and cannot be removed or sold separately from the villa. However, they may be at risk of damage or theft if the villa is not properly secured and maintained.</p><p>The eviction of Princess Rita marks the end of an era for the Villa Ludovisi and its artistic treasures. The villa has witnessed centuries of history and culture, from the Renaissance to the present day. It has been home to cardinals, princes, poets, and artists. It has also been a source of controversy and conflict, as different heirs and authorities have claimed ownership and control over it.</p><p>The future of the villa is now uncertain. It may find a new owner who will respect and restore its heritage, or it may fall into further decay and oblivion. It may remain open to the public, or it may become a private residence. It may remain in Italy, or it may be sold to a foreign buyer.</p><p>Whatever happens, the Villa Ludovisi and its Caravaggio ceiling will remain a unique and priceless part of the world's artistic legacy.</p><h6>Villa Ludovisi, Caravaggio, Princess Rita Jenrette Boncompagni Ludovisi, Rome, inheritance dispute</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
