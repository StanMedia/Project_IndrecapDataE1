One of the last survivors shares her story with CNN.</p><h2>The Largest Jewish Revolt in Nazi-Occupied Europe</h2><p>On April 19, 1943, the Nazis began their final operation to liquidate the Warsaw Ghetto, the largest Jewish ghetto in German-occupied Europe. About 400,000 Jews had been sealed off from the rest of the Polish capital behind a high wall topped with barbed wire since October 1940. Most of them had died from starvation, disease, or deportation to death camps.</p><p>But a small group of Jewish fighters, armed with homemade weapons and a few smuggled guns, decided to resist the Nazi onslaught. They were members of the Jewish Combat Organization (ZOB) and the Jewish Military Union (ZZW), two underground resistance groups that had formed alliances with Polish partisans outside the ghetto.</p><p>The fighters knew they had little chance of survival, but they wanted to die with dignity and honor. They also hoped to inspire other Jews to resist the Nazis and to draw attention to their plight. As one of the ZOB leaders, Mordechai Anielewicz, wrote in a letter: "The most important thing is that my life's dream has come true. Jewish self-defense in the ghetto has become a fact. Jewish resistance and revenge have become actualities. I have been witness to the magnificent heroic battle of the Jewish fighters."</p><p>The uprising lasted for almost a month, until May 16, 1943, when the Nazis razed the ghetto to the ground. About 13,000 Jews were killed in the fighting or burned alive in their hiding places. Another 50,000 were captured and deported to extermination or labor camps. Only a few hundred managed to escape through the sewers or tunnels, or with the help of Polish sympathizers.</p><p>The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was the largest and most significant act of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust. It was also the first urban uprising in Nazi-occupied Europe, preceding the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 by more than a year. It demonstrated the courage and resilience of the Jewish people, who refused to succumb to Nazi terror and genocide.</p><h2>A Teenage Messenger's Role in the Resistance</h2><p>One of the last surviving members of the Warsaw Ghetto resistance is Aliza Vitis-Shomron, who was then known by her maiden name, Melamed. She was only 15 years old when she joined a Zionist youth movement within the ghetto, which was affiliated with the ZOB.</p><p>She told CNN that she acted as a messenger, warning the Jews in different parts of the ghetto that the Nazis were planning to liquidate it. She also distributed leaflets with news and orders from the ZOB leadership. She hid them under her clothes or in her shoes, risking being caught and shot by the Germans.</p><p>She said: "The messengers were not fighters but had a very important mission to complete. It was very dangerous and we knew it."</p><p>Her parents had forbidden her to be involved in the resistance, but she carried on, determined to play her part. She said: "I felt that I had to do something for my people, for my nation."</p><p>Two days before the uprising erupted, she escaped the ghetto with her mother and 10-year-old sister by climbing over a wall. She had not wanted to leave, but followed the advice of one of the ZOB commanders, who told her that she could do more for the cause outside the ghetto.</p><p>She said: "I wanted to stay and fight with my fellow fighters. I felt that I was betraying them by leaving."</p><p>She joined a group of Jewish partisans in a nearby forest, where she continued to act as a courier and a liaison with other resistance groups. She also took part in sabotage operations against Nazi targets.</p><p>She survived the war and immigrated to Israel in 1946. She married and had three children and seven grandchildren. She became a teacher and a writer, publishing several books about her experiences.</p><p>She said: "I feel that I have a duty to tell my story and to keep alive the memory of those who fought and died in the ghetto. They were heroes who showed incredible bravery and sacrifice. They deserve our respect and admiration."</p><h2>The Commemoration of the Uprising and Its Lessons for Today</h2><p>The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is commemorated every year on April 19 in Poland and on 27 Nisan (the Hebrew date) in Israel and other countries. It is also recognized by the United Nations as the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust.</p><p>The commemoration honors the memory of those who fought and died in the ghetto, as well as those who helped them or survived. It also serves as a reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust and the need to prevent genocide and discrimination in the present and future.</p><p>On the 80th anniversary of the uprising, the presidents of Germany, Poland and Israel joined Holocaust survivors and their descendants at a ceremony in front of the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes' Memorial, a monument that depicts a group of fighters holding weapons and grenades.</p><p>German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed his deep shame for the crimes that Germans committed in the ghetto and asked for forgiveness. He also condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine and said that "never again" means that there must be no criminal war of aggression in Europe.</p><p>Polish President Andrzej Duda warned against sowing hatred and trampling on the graves of the heroes of the ghetto. He said that Poland will always defend its sovereignty and independence, as well as support Israel's right to exist.</p><p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog praised the heroism of the resistance and said that it offers a platform for dialogue and friendship between Poland and Israel. He also urged to combat antisemitism and Holocaust denial wherever they appear.</p><p>Marian Turski, a 96-year-old Polish Holocaust survivor, delivered a speech in which he said that German forces did the unimaginable in annihilating Jews, but that the "subsoil" of antisemitism existing for centuries made it possible for them to kill so many. He also warned against indifference in the face of rising hatred and violence in today's world.</p><p>Jewish and Christian clerics recited prayers and a torch burned from a part of the memorial resembling a Jewish menorah. A large group held private unofficial observances at other sites across the former ghetto, placing yellow daffodils or wearing small paper daffodils that have become a symbol of remembering the uprising.</p><p>The daffodil was chosen as a tribute to Marek Edelman, the last surviving leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, who used to receive a bouquet of yellow daffodils from an anonymous person every year on April 19. He would lay them at the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in memory of those who fought and died.</p><p>Organizers gave out 450,000 paper daffodils, as this was the number of people in the ghetto when its population was at its peak. Volunteers also handed out paper daffodils on the streets of Warsaw and other cities.</p><p>The commemoration was attended by ambassadors of dozens of countries, as well as representatives of Jewish organizations, civil society groups, and religious communities. It was broadcast live on television and online platforms.</p><p>The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising remains a powerful symbol of courage and resistance against oppression and injustice. It also inspires hope and solidarity among people who share common values and aspirations for peace and dignity.</p><h6>Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Holocaust, Resistance, Commemoration</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
