The CPJ spokesperson, Kally Maluku, told CNN that the boy had a fractured femur and a facial injury and the girl was safe.</p><p>"The injured child lost his mother while the other child's deceased mother and father are without trace," Maluku said.</p><p>The death toll has continued to rise in Bushushu and Nyamukubi after heavy rainfall through last week caused rivers to overflow and created mudslides that devastated the villages. Twenty-six more bodies were recovered on Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 438, according to updated government figures. More than 1000 people are still reported missing.</p><h2>The provincial government and humanitarian agencies are providing relief and support</h2><p>Provincial governor for South Kivu, Theo Kasi, told CNN earlier in the week that rescue operations were ongoing in spite of the difficulties.</p><p>"We are in a disaster. We work despite difficult conditions," he said.</p><p>The provincial government also said it was relocating residents affected by the floods to safer sites and funding medical care for the injured, as well as funeral costs for the deceased.</p><p>The DRC Red Cross said it was providing emergency assistance to more than 3000 people affected by the floods, including food, water, sanitation, hygiene kits, blankets and mosquito nets.</p><p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it was coordinating with humanitarian partners to assess the needs and deliver aid to the affected communities.</p><p>OCHA also said it was concerned about the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera and malaria due to the lack of clean water and sanitation facilities.</p><h2>The DRC is prone to frequent floods and landslides due to its geography and climate</h2><p>The DRC is located within the River Congo Basin where flood disasters are frequently reported and it continues to grapple with devastating effects of flooding across the country.</p><p>According to OCHA, more than 1.6 million people have been affected by floods in 2022 alone, with over 500 deaths recorded.</p><p>The DRC is also vulnerable to landslides due to its mountainous terrain and deforestation. At least 10 people were killed on Wednesday in another landslide in the country's Lubero territory, in its North Kivu Province, authorities said.</p><p>The DRC's climate is also changing due to global warming, which is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heavy rains, droughts and heat waves.</p><h6>Congo, floods, landslides, babies, survival</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
