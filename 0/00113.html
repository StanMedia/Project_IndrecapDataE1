Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the US, a key ally of Ukraine, was dictating the decisions and actions of Kyiv, which Russia blamed for launching the strike.</p><p>"We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are made not in Kyiv but in Washington," Peskov said. "And Kyiv is already executing what it is told to do."</p><p>Peskov did not provide any evidence to support his claims, nor additional details regarding the alleged attack, saying that information would be released later.</p><p>Russia had said on Wednesday that it shot down two drones aimed at the Kremlin before they reached Putin's official residence. The Russian Defense Ministry released a video showing the interception of one of the drones by a Pantsir-S1 air defense system.</p><p>The ministry said the drones were launched from Ukrainian territory and carried explosives and shrapnel. It also said it had evidence that the US and its allies were providing Ukraine with drones and other weapons.</p><h2>US rejects Russia's "ludicrous claim"</h2><p>The United States has dismissed as "ludicrous" Russia's claim that it was responsible for the drone attack against the Kremlin, an incident that risks inflaming international tensions.</p><p>White House National Security spokesman John Kirby denied on Thursday any US involvement in the attack on Wednesday, which Moscow said targeted President Vladimir Putin. Kirby stressed that Washington was not even aware of the details of what happened.</p><p>"Obviously it's a ludicrous claim. The United States had nothing to do with this," Kirby told CNN. "We don't even know exactly what happened here, but I can assure you the United States had no role in it whatsoever."</p><p>Kirby also said that Peskov was lying, "pure and simple", in a separate interview with MSNBC.</p><p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also expressed scepticism about the attack, saying on Wednesday that he would take anything out of the Kremlin with a "very large shaker of salt".</p><p>Blinken said the US was not dictating to Ukraine how to conduct its war efforts against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, where more than 13,000 people have been killed since 2014.</p><p>"We leave it to Ukraine to decide how it's going to defend itself, and how it's going to try to get back the territory that's been seized from it," he said.</p><h2>Ukraine denies involvement in attack</h2><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denied his country's involvement in the attack, saying that Ukrainians are fighting Russian troops on Ukrainian territory and would leave Putin's fate to a war crimes tribunal.</p><p>Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that Putin was looking for ways to motivate Russians to continue to fight in Ukraine, where Moscow has amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border.</p><p>"He needs some kind of reason for this war," Zelenskyy said. "He needs some kind of pretext."</p><p>Zelenskyy also accused Russia of staging provocations and false flag operations inside Ukraine and on its own territory, such as the accidental bombing of a residential building in Nizhny Novgorod last month, which killed six people.</p><p>Zelenskyy said he was ready to meet with Putin for peace talks, but only on Ukrainian soil or in a neutral country.</p><h2>Tensions rise between US and Russia</h2><p>The alleged drone attack on the Kremlin comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Russia over a range of issues, including Ukraine, human rights, cyberattacks, and nuclear arms control.</p><p>Moscow's deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned on Thursday that the two powers were on the precipice of an "open-armed conflict", and urged Washington to refrain from further sanctions and interference in Russia's internal affairs.</p><p>Ryabkov also said that Russia was ready to use force if necessary to defend its interests and security.</p><p>"We are ready for any scenario," he said. "We will respond harshly and decisively to any aggressive actions by the United States."</p><p>The US has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014, its interference in US elections and its involvement in a massive cyberattack on US government agencies and private companies.</p><p>The US has also imposed sanctions on Russia for its use of chemical weapons against opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is currently imprisoned in Russia, and for its alleged role in the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018.</p><p>The US has also sanctioned Russian individuals and entities for human rights abuses, such as the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey in 2018 and the repression of protesters in Belarus in 2020.</p><p>The EU has also imposed sanctions on Russia for similar reasons, as well as for its violation of the territorial integrity of Georgia and Moldova.</p><p>The UK has also imposed sanctions on Russia for its malicious cyber activities, such as the NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017 that affected businesses and organisations worldwide.</p><h2>International community condemns Russia's aggression</h2><p>The alleged drone attack on the Kremlin has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community, which has expressed solidarity with Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p><p>The G7 group of leading industrialised nations, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, issued a joint statement on Thursday denouncing Russia's "reckless and irresponsible" actions and demanding an immediate end to its military escalation.</p><p>The G7 also reaffirmed its commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and pledged to provide political, economic and humanitarian support to Kyiv.</p><p>The NATO alliance, which comprises 30 member states from Europe and North America, also issued a statement on Thursday expressing its "grave concern" over Russia's aggression and calling for a de-escalation of tensions.</p><p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that NATO was ready to defend any ally against any threat, and that it was enhancing its presence and readiness in the region.</p><p>Stoltenberg also said that NATO was providing Ukraine with practical and political support, such as training, equipment and intelligence sharing.</p><p>The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation in Ukraine, where it heard briefings from UN officials and representatives of Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged both sides to exercise maximum restraint and to engage in dialogue to prevent further escalation.</p><p>Guterres also called for full respect for international law and human rights, and for humanitarian access to civilians affected by the conflict.</p><p>Several other countries have also expressed their support for Ukraine and their condemnation of Russia's actions, such as Australia, India, Israel, Poland, Sweden and Turkey.</p><p>Some countries have also announced additional sanctions or measures against Russia, such as expelling Russian diplomats or suspending cooperation agreements.</p><h6>Russia-US relations, Ukraine conflict, drone attack</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
