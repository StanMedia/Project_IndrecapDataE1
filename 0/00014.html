There have been violent clashes between police and demonstrators.</p><p>The final approval of the pension reforms – which followed seven hours of debate within the nine-member Council – is a victory for Macron one year into his second presidential term, but the unpopularity of the new law has come at a great political cost with his approval ratings at near-record low levels.</p><h2>The new law aims to simplify and save money</h2><p>Macron's government has said the reform is necessary to keep the pension system's finances out of the red in the coming years.</p><p>The new law aims to unify 42 different pension systems into one universal system based on points. It also introduces incentives and penalties to encourage people to work longer and retire later.</p><p>From September, the first retirees will have to wait an additional three months for their state pensions. With regular, incremental increases, by 2030 the retirement age will have reached 64.</p><p>The French government will now be hoping that the protests, which had already shown signs of waning, will come to an end. But speaking to CNN in Paris, some protesters said they would remain in the streets.</p><p>"We expected it. It's not really a surprise and we don't really care actually because we want to fight until this reform is abandoned," said Sidonie Dauver.</p><p>"We are going to keep protesting because we need to be respected. People want to be respected towards social rights and social justice. We are against this pension reform," another protester, Jean-Baptiste Reddé, said.</p><p>The leader of French union CGT, one of France's main unions, has called for a "historic" protest on May 1.</p><p>"All French people, note down the date, we have to be in the street to stop this law from coming into force," Sophie Binet, the head of CGT, told CNN's affiliate BFMTV, vowing that protests will continue.</p><h2>The opposition fails to block or amend the law</h2><p>The Constitutional Council also refused a first request by opposition lawmakers to hold a referendum on enshrining 62 as the maximum official retirement age. A last-minute second request put forward Thursday to hold a referendum on the reform remains under consideration.</p><p>The opposition parties have accused Macron's party of using undemocratic methods to pass the law, such as invoking Article 49-3 of the constitution that allows the government to bypass parliament and adopt a bill without a vote.</p><p>They have also criticized the government for rushing through the reform without proper consultation or negotiation with unions and other stakeholders.</p><p>Macron has defended his reform as fair and necessary for France's future. He has also invited labor unions to meet with him on Tuesday "whatever the decision by the Constitutional Council," his office said.</p><p>The president did not grant a request last month by unions for a meeting.</p><h6>France, pension reform</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
