According to the World Health Organization, cancer was the second leading cause of death globally in 2020, accounting for an estimated 10 million deaths.</p><p>People with cancer often face many challenges, not only from the disease itself but also from the treatments they receive. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and other forms of cancer treatment can have various side effects on the body, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, loss of taste, mouth sores, and weight loss or gain .</p><p>These side effects can make it difficult for cancer patients to eat well and get enough nutrients. Poor nutrition can lead to malnutrition, which can weaken the immune system, increase the risk of infections, reduce the effectiveness of treatment, and worsen the quality of life .</p><p>Therefore, it is important for cancer patients to pay attention to their body changes and adjust their diet accordingly. Nutrition therapy, which is the use of food and supplements to meet the nutritional needs of people with cancer, can help them cope with treatment and improve their health outcomes .</p><h2>Nutrition therapy can vary depending on the type and stage of cancer</h2><p>Nutrition therapy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Different types and stages of cancer may require different dietary strategies. For example, people with pancreatic cancer may have trouble digesting food because of reduced enzyme production by the pancreas. They may need to take enzyme supplements and eat smaller, more frequent meals that are low in fat and high in protein. People with breast or endometrial cancer who receive hormone therapy may experience weight gain because of changes in metabolism. They may need to limit their calorie intake and increase their physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.</p><p>Nutrition therapy may also change over time as the cancer progresses or responds to treatment. For instance, people with advanced cancer may have more difficulty swallowing or absorbing nutrients. They may need to eat softer or liquid foods that are easy to swallow and digest, or receive tube feeding or intravenous nutrition if they cannot eat enough by mouth . People who have surgery to remove part of their stomach or intestines may need to eat smaller portions and avoid foods that cause gas or bloating.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential for cancer patients to consult with their doctors and dietitians before making any dietary changes. They should also monitor their weight, appetite, bowel movements, blood sugar levels, and other indicators of their nutritional status regularly and report any problems or concerns to their health care team .</p><h2>Nutrition therapy can include a variety of foods and supplements</h2><p>Nutrition therapy can help cancer patients meet their nutritional needs by providing them with a variety of foods and supplements that are rich in protein, healthy fats, whole grains, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals .</p><p>Protein is important for building and repairing tissues, maintaining muscle mass, fighting infections, and healing wounds. Good sources of protein include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, soy products, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and quinoa .</p><p>Healthy fats are essential for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), producing hormones, and supporting brain function. Good sources of healthy fats include olive oil, canola oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines) .</p><p>Whole grains are rich in carbohydrates, fiber, B vitamins, and minerals. They provide energy, aid digestion, and regulate blood sugar levels. Good sources of whole grains include oatmeal, brown rice, barley, bulgur, and whole wheat breads and cereals .</p><p>Vitamins and minerals are vital for many biochemical reactions and functions in the body. They help maintain normal cell growth and division, protect against oxidative stress and inflammation, and support immune system and bone health. Good sources of vitamins and minerals include fruits, vegetables, dark leafy greens, citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, pumpkin, and fortified foods (such as milk, juice, and cereals) .</p><p>Antioxidants and phytochemicals are compounds that have various beneficial effects on the body. They help prevent or repair damage caused by free radicals and other harmful molecules, modulate gene expression and enzyme activity, inhibit the growth or spread of cancer cells, and enhance the effects of cancer treatment. Good sources of antioxidants and phytochemicals include fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, tea, coffee, cocoa, red wine, and dark chocolate .</p><p>Supplements are products that contain concentrated amounts of nutrients or other substances that may have health benefits. They can be taken in the form of pills, capsules, powders, liquids, or injections. Supplements can help cancer patients who have specific nutritional deficiencies or needs that cannot be met by food alone. For example, people who have low levels of vitamin D, calcium, iron, or zinc may need to take supplements to prevent or treat osteoporosis, anemia, or infections .</p><p>However, supplements are not a substitute for a balanced diet and may have side effects or interactions with medications or other supplements. Therefore, cancer patients should always consult with their doctors and dietitians before taking any supplements and follow their recommendations carefully .</p><h2>Nutrition therapy can improve the quality of life and survival of cancer patients</h2><p>Nutrition therapy can have a positive impact on the quality of life and survival of cancer patients. Studies have shown that nutrition therapy can help cancer patients:</p><ul><li>Maintain or gain weight and muscle mass</li><li>Reduce treatment-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, pain, and infections</li><li>Enhance the response and tolerance to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy</li><li>Prevent or delay the recurrence or progression of cancer</li><li>Increase the overall survival and reduce the risk of death</li></ul><p>Therefore, nutrition therapy is an integral part of cancer care and should be tailored to the individual needs and preferences of each patient. Cancer patients should seek professional guidance and support from their health care team and follow a healthy and balanced diet that suits their condition and goals.</p><h6>Cancer, Nutrition Therapy, Diet, Supplements</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
