But this week, a new generation of politicians has emerged, bringing fresh perspectives and energy to the country's governance.</p><p>One of them is Ryosuke Takashima, who at 26 years old became Japan's youngest-ever mayor, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. He graduated last year from Harvard University, where he earned his bachelor's degree in environmental engineering.</p><p>He was elected as the mayor of Ashiya City in Hyogo Prefecture on April 25, after campaigning on green infrastructure planning, promising to create more public spaces and parks, as well as reforms in education, childcare and youth healthcare.</p><p>"Being young, I think there is a possibility that citizens will feel closer to me. Because I have no experience in politics, I can ask around what I don't understand, learn various things, and I want reflect them in my own vision," he told reporters, according to NHK.</p><p>He will begin serving as mayor on May 1, following the footsteps of Kotaro Shishida, who was elected as Japan's previous youngest mayor in 1994 at the age of 27.</p><p>Another young politician who made headlines is Shin the Hiratsuka YouTuber, who ran his campaign for Hiratsuka City Council under his official name. Shin is 26 years old and runs a Pokemon card store, but is best known for his YouTube channel, where he makes videos about local shops and events in the city.</p><p>It was while making these videos and talking to local business owners that Shin learned about their complaints and troubles, inspiring him to run for city council and freshen up the staid political scene, according to his website.</p><p>"Japan's politicians are aging," his site reads. "There are many high schools and universities in Hiratsuka, so there is no doubt that young people live here."</p><p>As a single father of a 3-year-old son, he focused on childcare issues during his campaign, highlighting the need for greater support for parents and work-life balance, as well as supporting the elderly, as Japan's population rapidly ages and its workforce shrinks.</p><h2>The Uyghur woman and the LGBTQ activist</h2><p>Japan's new wave of politicians also includes more diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. One of them is Arfiya Eri, whose parents are Uyghur and Uzbek. She is 34 years old and was elected as a member of Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly on April 25.</p><p>Eri has been an advocate for women's rights and gender equality since she was a teenager. She founded a nonprofit organization called Women's Eye in 2011 to empower women through education and leadership training. She also launched a campaign called #MeTooJapan in 2018 to raise awareness about sexual harassment and violence against women.</p><p>Eri said she decided to run for office after witnessing the lack of female representation and diversity in Japan's politics. She said she wanted to be a voice for women, minorities and marginalized groups who often face discrimination and prejudice in society.</p><p>"I want to create a society where everyone can live with dignity and respect," she said on her website. "I want to change Japan from within."</p><p>Another trailblazer is Taiga Ishikawa, who became Japan's first openly gay male lawmaker when he was elected to the upper house of parliament in 2019. He is 47 years old and has been an activist for LGBTQ rights since he came out at the age of 18.</p><p>He founded an LGBTQ support group called Peer Friends in 2004 and wrote a memoir titled "Boku no Kareshi wa Doko ni Iru?" (Where Is My Boyfriend?) in 2002. He also served as a member of Toshima Ward Assembly from 2011 to 2019.</p><p>Ishikawa said he ran for parliament to fight for legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Japan, which is the only G7 country that does not allow it. He also said he wanted to challenge the stereotypes and stigma that LGBTQ people face in Japan.</p><p>"I want to show that being gay is not something to be ashamed of, but something to be proud of," he said on his website.</p><h2>The challenges and opportunities</h2><p>Japan's new wave of politicians faces many challenges and opportunities as they enter office. They have to prove themselves to their constituents and colleagues, some of whom may doubt their abilities or experience. They also have to navigate the complex and often conservative political system, which may resist their ideas or reforms.</p><p>At the same time, they have the potential to bring positive change and innovation to Japan's politics and society. They can represent the voices and interests of young people, women, minorities and other marginalized groups who have been historically underrepresented or ignored. They can also use their online platforms and social media skills to reach out to a wider audience and engage them in civic participation.</p><p>Japan's new wave of politicians also reflects a global trend of young and diverse leaders emerging in various countries, such as New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin, France's President Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p><p>These leaders have shown that age, gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation are not barriers to leadership, but rather assets that can enrich their perspectives and policies. They have also shown that they can handle crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic with empathy, competence and resilience.</p><p>Japan's new wave of politicians may not have the same level of power or influence as these leaders, but they have the opportunity to learn from them and follow their footsteps. They may also inspire more young and diverse people to join politics and make their voices heard.</p><h6>Japan, politics, youth, diversity, online</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
