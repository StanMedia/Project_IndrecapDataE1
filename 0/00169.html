The 28-year-old from India’s Haryana state already has two degrees – a bachelor’s and a master’s – and is working on a third, all with a view to landing a well-paid job in one of the world’s fastest growing economies.</p><p>“I studied so that I can be successful in life,” he said. “When you work hard, you should be able to get a job.”</p><p>Kumar does now have a job, but it’s not the one he studied for – and definitely not the one he dreamed about. He has spent the past five years sweeping the floors of a school in his village, a full-time job he supplements with a less lucrative side hustle tutoring younger students. All told, he makes about $85 a month.</p><p>It’s not much, he concedes, especially as he needs to support two aging parents and a sister, but it is all he has. Ideally, he says, he’d work as a teacher and put his degrees to use. Instead, “I have to do manual labor just to be able to feed myself.”</p><p>Kumar’s situation is not unusual, but a predicament faced by millions of other young Indians. Youth unemployment in the country is climbing sharply, a development that risks undermining the new darling of the world economy at the very moment it was expected to really take off.</p><h2>The demographic dividend or disaster?</h2><p>India’s newfound status as the world’s most populous nation had prompted hopes of a youthful new engine for the global economy just as China’s population begins to dwindle and age. Unlike China’s, India’s working age population is young, growing, and projected to hit a billion over the next decade – a vast pool of labor and consumption that one Biden administration official has called an “economic miracle.”</p><p>But for young Indians like Kumar, there’s a flip side to this so-called miracle: too few jobs and too much competition.</p><p>In contrast to China, where economists fear there won’t be enough workers to support the growing number of elderly, in India the concern is there aren’t enough jobs to support the growing number of workers.</p><p>While people under the age of 25 account for more than 40% of India’s population, almost half of them – 45.8% – were unemployed as of December 2022, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank headquartered in Mumbai, which publishes job data more regularly than the Indian government.</p><p>Some analysts have described the situation to CNN as a “time bomb”, warning of the potential for social unrest unless more employment can be created.</p><p>Kumar, like others in his position, knows all too well the frustrations that can build when work is scarce.</p><p>“I get very angry that I don’t have a successful job despite my qualifications and education,” he said.</p><h2>The impact of Covid-19 and policy failures</h2><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has only worsened India’s youth unemployment crisis, as lockdowns and restrictions disrupted economic activity and forced many businesses to shut down or lay off workers.</p><p>According to CMIE data, India lost more than 10 million jobs between January and December 2022, with young people bearing the brunt of the losses. The unemployment rate for those aged 15-29 jumped from 17.7% in January 2022 to 27.7% in December 2022.</p><p>The pandemic also exposed the weaknesses of India’s education system, which has failed to equip many young people with the skills and training needed for the modern labor market.</p><p>According to the latest Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which surveyed rural students aged 14-18 in 2021, only about half of them could read an English sentence or solve a simple arithmetic problem. The report also found that only 16% had access to online learning during school closures.</p><p>Even those who manage to complete higher education often struggle to find suitable jobs that match their qualifications and aspirations. A 2019 study by Azim Premji University found that more than one-third of India’s formally trained youth were unemployed.</p><p>Experts say that India needs to invest more in improving its education quality and access, as well as creating more jobs in sectors that can absorb its large pool of young workers, such as manufacturing, services and agriculture.</p><h2>The need for urgent action and reform</h2><p>The Indian government has acknowledged the challenge of youth unemployment and has launched several initiatives to address it, such as the Skill India Mission, the Make in India campaign, and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA).</p><p>However, these programs have faced criticism for being inadequate, ineffective or poorly implemented. For instance, the Skill India Mission, which aims to train 400 million people by 2022, has been plagued by low enrollment, high dropout and low placement rates. The Make in India campaign, which seeks to boost manufacturing and exports, has been hampered by red tape, infrastructure bottlenecks and weak demand. The NREGA, which provides 100 days of guaranteed work per year to rural households, has suffered from delays in payments, corruption and low wages.</p><p>Many economists and analysts have called for more radical reforms to unleash India’s economic potential and create more opportunities for its young population. These include easing labor laws, improving infrastructure, simplifying taxation, enhancing governance, promoting innovation and fostering entrepreneurship.</p><p>India’s youth unemployment crisis is not only a threat to its economic growth and social stability, but also a waste of its human capital and potential. As Kumar puts it: “We have so much talent in our country, but we don’t have the opportunities to use it.”</p><h6>India, youth unemployment, economic miracle, demographic dividend, Covid-19</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
