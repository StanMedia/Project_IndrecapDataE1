According to a statement from Zelensky's office, the conversation lasted for an hour and was "productive" and "meaningful".</p><p>Xi reaffirmed China's position of neutrality and non-interference in the Ukrainian crisis, and called for a peaceful resolution through dialogue and negotiations. He said China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, and supports the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which were signed in 2015 to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Xi also announced that China would send a special envoy, Li Hui, to Ukraine and other countries to conduct "in-depth communication" with all parties involved in the crisis. Li is a former Chinese ambassador to Russia and a special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs.</p><h2>Zelensky welcomes China's role and seeks cooperation</h2><p>Zelensky welcomed China's role as a mediator and expressed his appreciation for China's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said Ukraine was ready to engage in dialogue with Russia, but stressed that there could be no peace unless Russia withdraws its troops from Ukrainian territory and returns Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.</p><p>Zelensky also said he hoped to strengthen bilateral cooperation with China in various fields, such as trade, investment, infrastructure, energy, agriculture, and culture. He invited Xi to visit Ukraine at a convenient time, and said he looked forward to meeting him in person.</p><p>Zelensky also announced that Ukraine had appointed its new ambassador to China, Oleksandr Horin, who had previously served as Ukraine's envoy to Poland and Israel.</p><h2>Background and analysis</h2><p>The phone call between Xi and Zelensky was widely anticipated as a sign of China's involvement in the Ukrainian crisis, which has escalated since Russia launched a large-scale military offensive against Ukraine in February 2023. The invasion has sparked international condemnation and sanctions from the US and its allies, as well as diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation.</p><p>China, as Russia's most important ally and trading partner, has maintained a delicate balance between supporting Moscow and avoiding alienating Kyiv. China has repeatedly stated that it is neutral in the conflict and does not take sides, but it has also refrained from criticizing Russia's actions or calling for its withdrawal. Instead, China has emphasized the need to respect the legitimate security concerns of all countries and accused NATO and the US of fueling the tension.</p><p>China has also sought to portray itself as a constructive force for peace and stability in the region and beyond. In March 2023, shortly after Xi unveiled a vague blueprint for peace in Ukraine and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, China helped broker a deal for Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic ties.</p><p>However, China's image as a peacemaker has been tarnished by some controversial remarks by its diplomats. In April 2023, China's ambassador to France sparked fury in Europe when he questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet republics under international law. The comments provoked anger from Baltic states and others, and China later removed a transcript of the remarks and said they did not represent government policy.</p><p>The phone call between Xi and Zelensky may be seen as an attempt by China to repair its reputation and demonstrate its willingness to engage with both sides of the conflict. However, it remains unclear whether China can play a significant role in resolving the crisis or persuading Russia to change its course. Analysts say that China's interests lie more in maintaining its strategic partnership with Russia and avoiding direct confrontation with the US than in mediating between Moscow and Kyiv.</p><h6>Xi Jinping, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine crisis, Russia invasion</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
