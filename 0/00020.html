He also claimed to be the leader of a group called the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), which was banned by India as a terrorist organization.</p><p>Singh, 30, was born in a village in Punjab, the northern state that is home to most of India's Sikhs. He studied at a religious school and became a priest at a local Sikh temple. He later moved to Canada, where he obtained citizenship and continued his preaching activities.</p><p>He returned to India in February 2023, after the Indian government revoked his overseas citizenship. He said he wanted to participate in the farmers' protests that have been ongoing since November 2020 against new agricultural laws. The protests have drawn support from many Sikhs, who form a large part of the farming community.</p><p>However, Singh soon became a controversial figure for his radical views and incendiary rhetoric. He accused the Indian government of oppressing Sikhs and other minorities, and urged them to take up arms and fight for their rights. He also denounced other Sikh leaders and organizations that did not support his separatist agenda.</p><h2>How was he arrested?</h2><p>Singh had been on the run since March 18, when police raided his hideout in Punjab and arrested several of his associates. He managed to escape by jumping into a canal and swimming away.</p><p>Since then, he had been evading capture by changing his appearance and location frequently. He also used social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook to broadcast his messages and challenge the authorities.</p><p>He was finally arrested on April 22 in Moga, a district in Punjab, after police received a tip-off from an informant. He was found hiding in a house belonging to one of his followers. Police said they recovered several weapons and explosives from his possession.</p><p>He was taken to Dibrugarh in Assam, a northeastern state where he faces charges of attempted murder and sedition for allegedly instigating violence during a rally on January 26, India's Republic Day. He is also wanted in several other states for similar offences.</p><h2>What is the reaction to his arrest?</h2><p>His arrest has been hailed by the Indian government and security agencies as a major achievement in their efforts to curb separatist activities and maintain law and order. Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated the Punjab police for their "exemplary work" and said that Singh "roamed freely but could not escape the eyes of our security forces".</p><p>However, some of his supporters and sympathizers have condemned his arrest as a violation of human rights and religious freedom. They have also alleged that he was tortured and mistreated by the police. They have demanded his immediate release and fair trial.</p><p>The arrest has also raised questions about the role of foreign countries, especially Canada, in providing shelter and support to Sikh separatists. India has accused Canada of being soft on such groups and allowing them to operate freely on its soil. Canada has denied these allegations and said that it respects India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><h2>What is the background of Sikh separatism?</h2><p>Sikh separatism is a decades-old issue that has its roots in the historical grievances and aspirations of the Sikh community in India. Sikhs are a religious minority that make up about 2% of India's population. They have a distinct identity, culture, and history that sets them apart from other groups.</p><p>The demand for Khalistan emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, when some Sikhs felt alienated and discriminated by the central government led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. They accused her of interfering in their religious affairs and imposing emergency rule that curbed civil liberties.</p><p>The movement turned violent under the leadership of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a charismatic preacher who advocated armed struggle against the state. He took refuge in the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of Sikhs, in Amritsar. In June 1984, Gandhi ordered a military operation to flush him out, which resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and damage to the temple.</p><p>The operation sparked widespread anger and resentment among Sikhs, who saw it as an attack on their faith and dignity. In October 1984, Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, who sought revenge for the temple assault. This triggered a wave of anti-Sikh riots across India, especially in Delhi, where thousands of Sikhs were killed by mobs.</p><p>The violence subsided in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after a series of crackdowns by the Indian security forces and the loss of public support for the militants. The last major attack by Sikh separatists was in 1995, when they assassinated Punjab chief minister Beant Singh.</p><p>Since then, the demand for Khalistan has largely faded from mainstream Sikh politics, though some fringe groups and individuals continue to espouse it. Most Sikhs have reconciled with the Indian state and have participated in its democratic processes. Many have also achieved success and prominence in various fields such as business, sports, entertainment, and politics.</p><h2>What is the current status of the movement?</h2><p>The Khalistan movement is largely dormant within India, but it has some support among the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries have large Sikh populations that migrated from India in search of better opportunities and religious freedom.</p><p>Some of these overseas Sikhs have formed organizations that lobby for Khalistan and raise funds for its cause. They also organize events and rallies to commemorate the events of 1984 and to protest against alleged human rights violations by India. Some of them have also been accused of providing material and moral support to Sikh extremists in India.</p><p>India has repeatedly expressed its concern over the activities of these pro-Khalistan groups and has urged foreign governments to curb their influence and activities. India has also sought the extradition of some of these individuals who are wanted for crimes related to terrorism and separatism.</p><p>However, these countries have often resisted India's demands, citing their own laws and policies on freedom of expression, asylum, and human rights. They have also maintained that they do not support any violent or unlawful actions by any group or individual.</p><h2>What are the implications for India's security and stability?</h2><p>The revival of the Khalistan movement poses a serious challenge for India's security and stability, as it threatens to reignite communal tensions and violence in Punjab and other parts of the country. It also undermines India's territorial integrity and sovereignty, as it challenges its constitutional framework and democratic system.</p><p>The movement also has implications for India's relations with its neighbors and allies, especially Pakistan and Canada. Pakistan has been accused by India of supporting and sheltering Sikh separatists as part of its strategy to destabilize India and create trouble in Kashmir. Canada has been criticized by India for being lenient and tolerant towards pro-Khalistan groups and individuals who operate on its soil.</p><p>India has to balance its interests and concerns with these countries while dealing with the Khalistan issue. It has to ensure that it does not alienate or antagonize them, while also protecting its own national security and unity.</p><h6>Khalistan, Sikh separatism, Amritpal Singh, Punjab</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
