Women's groups in the Catholic church - who have for years been demanding the right to vote at the high-profile synods - praised the move as historic, for an institution that has been male-dominated for centuries.</p><p>The new rules announced on Wednesday will give five religious sisters voting rights at the synod, which is a papal advisory body. In the past, women were only allowed to attend the gathering as observers.</p><p>The US-based Women's Ordination Conference, which advocates for women priests, called the reform "a significant crack in the stained glass ceiling".</p><p>"For years Vatican representatives and bishops resisted, moving the goalpost with every synod as to why women were not allowed to vote," the group wrote on Twitter. "The unspoken reason was always sexism."</p><p>"In the near future, we hope that the synod continues to develop into a fully representative body of the people of God."</p><p>In a further break with tradition, Pope Francis announced that voting rights would also be extended to 70 hand-picked non-clerical members of the religious community, moving the synod away from being a meeting solely of the Church hierarchy.</p><p>The Pope, who has championed reform, has said that he hopes half of these will be women and there has also been an emphasis on including young people.</p><p>"It's an important change, it's not a revolution," said Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich, a top organiser of the synod.</p><h2>Synod to discuss 'synodality' and lay involvement</h2><p>The theme of the October synod is "synodality", which will look at the involvement of lay people in the governance of the church among other topics.</p><p>The October meeting is part of a three-year long synodal process which will conclude in 2024.</p><p>A synod is a gathering of bishops which takes place at the request of the pope to discuss a particular topic. It does not have authority to set rules or change church doctrine, but is a consultative body which votes on proposals for the pope.</p><p>Announcing the changes on behalf of the pope were Cardinal Mario Grech, Secretary General of the Secretariat for the Synod, and Cardinal Hollerich.</p><p>Speaking at a press conference at the Holy See on Wednesday, they said: "This is not a revolution but an important change."</p><p>Christopher Lamb, Vatican correspondent for the Catholic news publication The Tablet, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme that the changes were "highly significant" and an attempt by the Pope to make decisions about the Church's future more inclusive.</p><p>He added that the reforms concerning women reflected an "unprecedented" dialogue over the issue of female representation that had been happening for some time.</p><p>But Mr Lamb predicted the Pope would face "significant resistance" from some parts of the Church over this latest decision.</p><h2>Pope Francis pushes for more reforms</h2><p>Pope Francis has been pushing for more reforms in the Church since his election in 2013. He has called for a more decentralized and collegial Church, where bishops and lay people have more say in decision-making.</p><p>He has also expressed support for more roles for women in the Church, although he has ruled out ordaining them as priests.</p><p>In 2019, he appointed six women to senior roles in one of the Vatican's most important offices - another unprecedented move.</p><p>He has also faced criticism from some conservative Catholics who accuse him of undermining traditional doctrine and discipline.</p><p>Last year, he faced backlash from some cardinals after he approved civil unions for same-sex couples.</p><p>Pope Francis has said he is not afraid of schism or dissent within the Church, but he has also urged dialogue and respect among different factions.</p><h6>Pope Francis, women, synod, bishops, Catholic Church</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
