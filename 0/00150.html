They said they would prepare a report for the coroner.</p><p>Police Inspector Mark Henderson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Darmody had met a "tragic, tragic ending".</p><h2>The crocodile habitat</h2><p>Rinyirru National Park is known as crocodile or "croc" country, according to the DES. The park is home to both estuarine or saltwater crocodiles and freshwater crocodiles, which are relatively shy and rarely attack humans.</p><p>Estuarine crocodiles are the largest living reptiles in the world and can grow up to six meters (20 feet) long. They are opportunistic predators that can attack anything that comes near the water, including fish, birds, mammals and humans.</p><p>The DES warns visitors to the park to be "crocwise" and avoid swimming, fishing or camping near the water's edge. It also advises people to never feed or provoke crocodiles, as this can make them more aggressive and dangerous.</p><p>According to DES, the "vast majority" of attacks are carried out by crocodiles larger than two meters (over six feet).</p><h2>The rare occurrence</h2><p>Although crocodiles are common in the area, fatal attacks are rare. This is just the 13th fatal attack in Queensland since the state government began keeping records in 1985.</p><p>Michael Joyce, the DES northern wildlife operations manager, told the ABC that it was highly unusual to find two crocodiles feeding on the remains of one human victim.</p><p>"We didn't believe it was common, but this is the second time this has occurred," he said, adding that "it's obviously something that does occur in crocodile populations as far as behavior is concerned."</p><p>He said that rangers killed the crocodiles "within 10 seconds of one another" and that they would conduct a necropsy to determine their age, sex and health.</p><p>He also expressed his condolences to Darmody's family and friends.</p><h2>The crocodile attacks</h2><p>Australia has a record of crocodiles hurting people, especially in the northern regions where saltwater crocodiles are abundant and can grow up to six meters (20 feet) long.</p><p>According to a website created by wildlife researchers Erin and Adam Britton, since 1971 Australia has witnessed 99 attacks on people by saltwater crocodiles, of which 27% were fatal. On average that’s around 2.3 attacks per year over four decades, of which 0.6 were fatal.</p><p>The website, called CrocBITE, collects data on crocodilian attacks from around the world and aims to provide accurate and reliable information for researchers, managers and the public.</p><p>The website shows that most of the attacks in Australia occurred in the Northern Territory, followed by Queensland and Western Australia. The majority of the victims were male, and the most common activities that led to attacks were fishing, swimming and boating.</p><p>The website also reveals that crocodile attacks have increased over time, as the population of saltwater crocodiles recovered from near extinction in the 1970s due to hunting and habitat loss. The species is now protected by law and estimated to number around 100,000 in the wild.</p><h2>The crocodile management</h2><p>Australia has a comprehensive crocodile management system that aims to balance the conservation of the species with the safety of people and livestock.</p><p>The system involves monitoring and surveying crocodile populations, educating and raising awareness among the public, enforcing laws and regulations, and implementing crocodile removal programs.</p><p>In areas where crocodiles pose a high risk to human safety, such as urban waterways and popular swimming spots, wildlife officers set traps and capture any crocodiles that are larger than two meters (over six feet). These crocodiles are either relocated to remote areas or transferred to farms or zoos.</p><p>In areas where crocodiles pose a moderate risk, such as rural waterways and fishing areas, wildlife officers only remove problem crocodiles that have shown aggressive or unusual behavior. These crocodiles are also relocated or transferred.</p><p>In areas where crocodiles pose a low risk, such as remote waterways and national parks, wildlife officers do not interfere with crocodiles unless they pose a threat to endangered species or research projects. These crocodiles are left alone.</p><h2>The crocodile coexistence</h2><p>Australia has a long history of coexisting with crocodiles, especially among Indigenous communities who have cultural and spiritual connections with the animals.</p><p>Many Indigenous people regard crocodiles as ancestors, totems or guardians, and have traditional knowledge and practices that help them avoid or reduce conflicts with them.</p><p>Some Indigenous people also participate in sustainable use of crocodiles, such as harvesting eggs or skins for economic benefits or cultural purposes.</p><p>However, coexisting with crocodiles also requires constant vigilance and caution from everyone who lives in or visits crocodile habitats.</p><p>The DES advises people to be "crocwise" and follow some simple rules to reduce the risk of attacks:</p><ul><li>Obey all warning signs and barriers</li><li>Stay away from the water's edge</li><li>Never swim or wade in water where crocodiles may live</li><li>Never feed or provoke crocodiles</li><li>Always supervise children and pets near water</li><li>Be extra careful at night, dawn and dusk</li><li>Report any sightings or incidents to authorities</li></ul><p>By following these rules, people can enjoy the natural beauty and diversity of Australia's waterways without becoming a victim of a crocodile attack.</p><h6>Crocodile, Fisherman, Australia, Attack</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
