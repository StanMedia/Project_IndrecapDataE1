The student had been caving with 14 classmates and two teachers from Whangārei Boys' High School at the Abbey Caves complex near Whangārei on Tuesday morning when the group got into difficulties. The student, whose name has not been released, became separated from the others and was swept away by the water.</p><p>Police superintendent Tony Hill, a Northland District Commander, said rescue workers located and recovered a body on Tuesday evening, but had not formally identified it. "We acknowledge this event has been very distressing for the school and wider community, and that there are a number of questions the public will have," Hill said in a statement. "Our thoughts remain with them at this tragic time."</p><p>Hill said the search was suspended after the body was found, but specialist equipment brought up from Auckland allowed them to work into the night. He said police were supporting those affected by the incident and reminded people to not make assumptions as to what had occurred.</p><h2>The reaction and investigation</h2><p>The school's principal Karen Gilbert-Smith described the ordeal as "hugely upsetting for all concerned" in a post to the school's Facebook page on Tuesday. She said "in time we will seek to understand how" the tragedy unfolded. She also thanked the emergency services and volunteers who helped with the search.</p><p>Some angry parents have questioned why the school trip was allowed to go ahead to visit the caves, which are prone to flash flooding, despite recent heavy rain. Up to 13 centimeters (5 inches) of rainfall was recorded on Tuesday alone in parts of the region, which suffered widespread flooding.</p><p>The Abbey Caves are a popular attraction for tourists and locals alike, featuring limestone formations, glow worms and underground streams. However, they can also be dangerous, especially after heavy rain, as water levels can rise rapidly and block exits. According to the Whangārei District Council website, visitors are advised to check weather conditions before entering the caves and avoid them if there is any sign of rain.</p><p>The Ministry of Education said it was working with the school to provide support and guidance. It also said it would review the incident to see if any lessons could be learned for future outdoor education activities.</p><h2>The Abbey Caves system and its attractions and risks</h2><p>The Abbey Caves are a system of three limestone caves located about four kilometers (2.5 miles) from Whangārei city center. They are named after the nearby Abbey Farm, which was established by Scottish settlers in the 19th century. The caves are known for their natural beauty, featuring stalactites, stalagmites, columns and flowstones. They are also home to thousands of glow worms, which produce a bioluminescent light that attracts visitors.</p><p>The caves are accessible to the public for free and do not require a guide or a permit. However, they are not maintained or monitored by any authority and visitors enter at their own risk. The caves can be challenging and dangerous, especially for inexperienced or unprepared cavers. They require crawling, climbing and wading through water, which can be cold and deep. The caves can also flood quickly and unexpectedly after heavy rain, trapping or drowning people inside.</p><p>According to the Whangārei District Council website, visitors are advised to check weather conditions before entering the caves and avoid them if there is any sign of rain. They are also advised to wear appropriate clothing and footwear, carry a torch and spare batteries, tell someone where they are going and when they expect to return, and never go alone or leave anyone behind.</p><p>The Abbey Caves have been the site of several accidents and rescues in the past. In 2012, two tourists were rescued after spending 22 hours trapped in one of the caves due to flooding. In 2014, a woman was rescued after falling and injuring her ankle in another cave. In 2016, a man was rescued after becoming stuck in a narrow passage in the third cave.</p><p>The recent tragedy of the missing student has raised questions about the safety and regulation of the caves. Some have called for more signage, warnings and education for visitors, while others have suggested restricting access or charging fees. However, some locals and cavers have defended the caves as a natural treasure that should remain open and free for everyone to enjoy responsibly.</p><h6>New Zealand, caves, flooding, student, tragedy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
