However, the meeting was dominated by the condemnation of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022 and continues to this day.</p><p>Lavrov was in charge of the meeting because Russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council, a position that rotates alphabetically among its 15 member nations every month. Russia assumed the presidency on April 1, an event that multiple diplomats described as an "April Fool's joke."</p><p>The meeting was attended by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and representatives from all 15 members of the Security Council, including five permanent members: China, France, Russia, the UK and the US. The meeting was also attended by Elizabeth Whelan, whose brother Paul Whelan has been detained in Russia for more than four years. The US considers Whelan to be wrongfully detained.</p><h2>Western diplomats slam Russia's aggression</h2><p>Opening the session, Guterres condemned Russia's actions, saying they violated the UN Charter and international law. "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is causing massive suffering and devastation to the country and its people and adding to the global economic dislocation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic," he said, sitting right next to Lavrov.</p><p>UN ambassadors for the US, UK and Switzerland all used their speeches at the meeting to criticize Russia's invasion. The three women - the US's Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Britain's Barbara Woodward and Switzerland's Pascale Baeriswyl - all voiced strong, direct criticism of Russia and Lavrov, at times looking directly at the top Russian diplomat.</p><p>"Our hypocritical convener today, Russia, invaded its neighbor, Ukraine, and struck at the heart of the UN Charter. This illegal, unprovoked and unnecessary war runs directly counter to our most shared principles - that a war of aggression and territorial conquest is never, ever acceptable," Thomas-Greenfield said.</p><p>"As we sit here, that aggression continues. As we sit here, Russian forces continue to kill and injure civilians. As we sit here, Russian forces are destroying Ukraine's critical infrastructure. As we sit here we brace ourselves for the next Bucha, the next Mariupol, the next Kherson, the next war crime, the next atrocity," she added.</p><p>Woodward echoed Thomas-Greenfield's remarks, saying that Russia's invasion was "a flagrant breach of international law" and "a threat to international peace and security." She also accused Russia of spreading misinformation and propaganda about Ukraine and its allies.</p><p>Baeriswyl said that Switzerland was "deeply concerned" by the situation in Ukraine and called for an immediate ceasefire and a political solution based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. She also urged Russia to release all political prisoners and respect human rights.</p><h2>Lavrov defends Russia's position</h2><p>Lavrov defended Russia's position, claiming that his country was acting in self-defense and in response to NATO's expansion and provocation. He accused NATO of violating previous agreements with Russia and deploying troops and weapons near Russia's borders.</p><p>He also blamed Ukraine for escalating the conflict by refusing to implement the Minsk agreements, a set of peace accords signed in 2015 to end a previous war between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. He said that Ukraine was pursuing a "neo-Nazi" ideology and oppressing its Russian-speaking minority.</p><p>Lavrov called for a dialogue between all parties involved in the conflict, including representatives from eastern Ukraine. He also proposed a new security architecture for Europe that would take into account Russia's interests and concerns.</p><h2>Background on Ukraine-Russia conflict</h2><p>The conflict between Ukraine and Russia dates back to 2014, when a popular uprising in Ukraine ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and triggered a wave of protests in eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists. Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine, in March 2014 and supported the separatists with weapons and troops.</p><p>A ceasefire agreement was reached in Minsk in February 2015, but it was repeatedly violated by both sides. The war claimed more than 13,000 lives and displaced more than a million people.</p><p>In November 2021, Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, sparking fears of a new invasion. Russia denied any plans to attack Ukraine and accused NATO of provoking tensions by supporting Kyiv and deploying troops and weapons in Eastern Europe.</p><p>On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a surprise attack on Ukraine from multiple directions, using air strikes, artillery, tanks and infantry. Russia claimed it was acting in self-defense and in response to NATO's expansion and provocation. Russia also said it was supporting the Russian-speaking minority in Ukraine, who it claimed were oppressed by the Ukrainian government.</p><p>The invasion triggered a global crisis and a humanitarian catastrophe. The UN Security Council held several emergency meetings, but failed to agree on a resolution to stop the war. The US and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia and provided military aid to Ukraine. China remained neutral, while some countries such as Belarus, Syria and Venezuela expressed support for Russia.</p><p>The war has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides, and instigated Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. About 8 million Ukrainians were displaced within their country by June 2022, and more than 8.1 million had fled the country by March 2023. The war has also caused widespread damage to Ukraine's infrastructure, economy and environment.</p><h2>The current situation</h2><p>As of April 2023, the war is still ongoing, but with varying intensity along different fronts. Russia has retreated from the northern front towards Kyiv, after facing fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces and volunteers. However, Russia still controls parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, including Crimea and Donbas.</p><p>In late 2022, Ukraine launched counteroffensives in the south and in the east, recapturing some territory from Russia. In November 2022, Ukraine retook Kherson, a strategic city on the coast. In February 2023, Ukraine liberated Lyman, a city in the Kharkiv region.</p><p>However, Russia has also reinforced its troops and launched new attacks on several occasions. In April 2023, Russia mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers for a renewed offensive towards Bakhmut, a city in the Donetsk region. Russia has also continued to bomb both military and civilian targets far from the front line, including Ukraine's energy grid throughout the winter.</p><p>The international community has been trying to find a diplomatic solution to end the war and restore Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Several rounds of talks have been held in various formats and venues, involving representatives from Ukraine, Russia, France, Germany, the US and other countries. However, no breakthrough has been achieved so far.</p><p>Russia has insisted on a list of demands that would effectively limit Ukraine's sovereignty and security choices. Among other things, Russia wants NATO to withdraw its troops and weapons from Eastern Europe, to renounce any plans to admit Ukraine or Georgia as members, and to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. Russia also wants Ukraine to grant autonomy and amnesty to the separatists in Donbas.</p><p>Ukraine has rejected Russia's demands as unacceptable and illegal. Ukraine insists on its right to choose its own alliances and to restore its control over all its territory. Ukraine also demands that Russia withdraws its troops and weapons from Ukraine's borders and occupied regions, respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, releases all political prisoners and pays reparations for the damage caused by the war.</p><p>The prospects for a peaceful resolution of the conflict remain uncertain. Both sides have expressed their willingness to negotiate, but also their readiness to defend their interests by force if necessary. The international community has called for restraint and dialogue, but also warned of serious consequences if the war escalates further.</p><h6>Ukraine-Russia conflict; UN Security Council; Sergey Lavrov; Volodymyr Zelenskyy; NATO</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
