There are those who want to end reliance on a technology they view as unsustainable, dangerous and a distraction from speeding up renewable energy. But for others, closing down nuclear plants is short-sighted. They see it as turning off the tap on a reliable source of low-carbon energy at a time when drastic cuts to planet-heating pollution are needed.</p><p>The move also makes Germany an outlier in much of the industrialized world. Britain, Finland and France are doubling down on nuclear energy as a source of reliable electricity and extremely low carbon emissions. Poland signed with Westinghouse Electric last year to build its first nuclear power plant, some 200 miles east of the German border.</p><h2>Germany pursues a green energy transition</h2><p>Germany's move to phase out nuclear energy is part of its ambitious vision to achieve a green energy transition, known as Energiewende. The country aims to generate 80% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2045.</p><p>The country has already made significant progress in expanding its renewable energy capacity, especially in wind and solar power. In 2020, renewable sources accounted for 46% of Germany's electricity generation, up from 6% in 2000.</p><p>Germany also plans to phase out coal power by 2038, another major source of greenhouse gas emissions. The country has set aside €40 billion ($45 billion) to support regions affected by the coal exit and help them transition to new industries.</p><p>The government says that ending nuclear and coal power is necessary for Germany's future and its international commitments under the Paris climate agreement.</p><p>"The position of the German government is clear: nuclear power is not green. Nor is it sustainable," Steffi Lemke, Germany's Federal Minister for the Environment and Consumer Protection and a Green Party member, told CNN. "We are embarking on a new era of energy production," she said.</p><h2>Germany faces energy security and climate challenges</h2><p>However, Germany's energy transition also comes with challenges and trade-offs. The country still relies on natural gas imports from Russia for about half of its gas supply, which raises concerns about energy security and dependence on a geopolitical rival.</p><p>The recent surge in gas prices across Europe has also put pressure on Germany's economy and consumers, who already pay some of the highest electricity bills in the region. The government has announced measures to ease the burden on households and businesses, such as lowering taxes and providing subsidies.</p><p>Some experts also question whether Germany can meet its climate goals without nuclear power, which currently provides about 10% of its electricity with virtually no emissions. They argue that phasing out nuclear power too soon will increase the demand for fossil fuels and make it harder to decarbonize the economy.</p><p>Others point out that nuclear power is not without environmental and social costs, such as radioactive waste disposal, safety risks and human rights violations in uranium mining.</p><p>Germany's decision to quit nuclear power has also sparked debates in neighboring countries, some of which rely on German electricity exports or operate their own nuclear plants near the border.</p><p>The closure of Germany's last nuclear plants will be a historic moment for the country and its people, who have been divided over the issue for decades. It will also be a test case for the world, as it shows whether a major industrialized nation can successfully transition to a low-carbon future without nuclear power.</p><h6>Germany, nuclear power</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
