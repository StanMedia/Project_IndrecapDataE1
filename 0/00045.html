This is the deepest observation of a fish ever made, surpassing the previous record of 8,178 meters (26,831 feet) set by another snailfish in the Mariana Trench in 2014.</p><p>The snailfish was recorded by an autonomous lander, a robotic device equipped with high-resolution cameras and bait to attract sea life. The lander was deployed from a ship, the DSSV Pressure Drop, as part of a two-month expedition to explore three deep-sea trenches in the northern Pacific Ocean: the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches.</p><p>The scientists also managed to catch two specimens of snailfish at a slightly shallower depth of 8,022 meters (26,312 feet) in the nearby Japan Trench. These specimens were brought to the surface and preserved for further analysis. They represent the deepest fish ever caught by humans.</p><h2>The remarkable snailfish</h2><p>Snailfish are a diverse group of fish that belong to the family Liparidae. There are over 300 species of snailfish, most of which live in shallow waters and can be found in river estuaries. However, some snailfish have adapted to life in the cold and dark depths of the Arctic and Antarctic oceans, and also in the extreme pressure conditions of the world's deepest trenches.</p><p>At 8 kilometers (5 miles) down, snailfish experience more than 80 megapascals, or 800 times the pressure at the ocean surface. To cope with this environment, they have gelatinous bodies that lack bones and scales. They also do not have swim bladders, the gas-filled organs that help other fish control their buoyancy. Instead, they rely on their large pectoral fins and tail to swim slowly and gracefully above the seabed.</p><p>Snailfish are also opportunistic feeders that consume tiny crustaceans, worms and other invertebrates that live in the trenches. They use their large mouths and teeth to create suction and swallow their prey whole.</p><p>The snailfish filmed and caught by the scientists belong to the genus Pseudoliparis, which includes several species that have been discovered in recent years in different trenches around the world. The exact species of the snailfish observed at 8,336 meters is not yet confirmed, but it is likely to be a new one.</p><h2>The significance of the discovery</h2><p>The discovery of a fish at such a great depth is significant for several reasons. First, it shows how far a particular type of fish can descend in the ocean. According to Prof. Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre and leader of the expedition, snailfish could be at or very close to the maximum depth any fish can survive.</p><p>Prof. Jamieson made a prediction 10 years ago that fish would likely be found as deep as 8,200 to 8,400 meters (26,900 to 27,600 feet) based on theoretical calculations of how much oxygen they would need to sustain their metabolism. A decade of investigations around the globe has confirmed this hypothesis.</p><p>"If this record is broken, it would only be by minute increments, potentially by just a few meters," Prof. Jamieson told BBC News.</p><p>Second, the discovery reveals more about the biodiversity and ecology of the deep-sea trenches, which are among the least explored habitats on Earth. Despite being isolated from each other by thousands of kilometers of ocean floor, trenches share some common features and species that have evolved independently to cope with similar challenges.</p><p>For example, snailfish are not the only animals that have been found at extreme depths. In 2016, scientists filmed an octopus at 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) in the Mariana Trench. In 2019, they recorded a giant amphipod crustacean at 8 kilometers (5 miles) down in the Kermadec Trench near New Zealand.</p><p>These discoveries suggest that there is more life in the deep-sea trenches than previously thought, and that there may be more to discover.</p><p>Third, the discovery contributes to the advancement of deep-sea exploration technologies and methods. The scientists used a combination of autonomous landers, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and manned submersibles to conduct their surveys. They also employed novel techniques to collect and preserve specimens from such great depths without damaging them.</p><p>These technologies and methods enable scientists to access and study regions of the ocean that were once inaccessible or poorly understood. They also provide valuable data and insights for the management and conservation of deep-sea resources and ecosystems, which are increasingly threatened by human activities such as fishing, mining, and pollution.</p><h2>The future of deep-sea research</h2><p>The scientists who filmed and caught the record-breaking snailfish are part of a larger project that aims to study the deep-sea fish populations in different trenches around the world. The project is funded by Caladan Oceanic, a private company that supports ocean exploration and research.</p><p>The project is also aligned with the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, which runs from 2021 to 2030. The Ocean Decade is a global initiative that seeks to mobilize the scientific community, policymakers, civil society, and other stakeholders to generate and use ocean knowledge for sustainable development.</p><p>One of the goals of the Ocean Decade is to increase the understanding and awareness of the deep sea and its role in supporting life on Earth. The Ocean Decade also calls for more collaboration and capacity-building among different actors and regions to address the challenges and opportunities of the deep sea.</p><p>The discovery of the deepest fish ever filmed and caught is an example of how deep-sea research can contribute to these goals. It showcases the diversity and adaptability of life in the ocean, the potential for new discoveries and innovations, and the need for responsible stewardship of this vast frontier.</p><h6>Deep sea, Snailfish, Trenches, Ocean Decade</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
