It was the first Chinese spacecraft to successfully touch down on the red planet, making China the third country to achieve a soft landing on Mars after the United States and the former Soviet Union.</p><p>The rover's primary mission was to search for signs of ancient life and study the minerals, environment and distribution of water and ice in Utopia Planitia, a large plain in Mars' northern hemisphere. It carried six scientific instruments, including a high-resolution topography camera, a multispectral camera, a subsurface radar, a surface composition detector, a magnetic field detector and a meteorological station.</p><p>According to Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of China's Mars exploration program, Zhurong had explored the Martian surface for 358 days and traveled for 1,921 meters (6,302 feet) as of April 25, 2023. The rover had exceeded its original design life of 90 Martian days (about three Earth months) and collected valuable data for scientific research.</p><p>Zhurong also captured stunning images and videos of Mars using its cameras and a separable camera that it deployed on the ground. The rover also left its mark on the planet by imprinting China's national flag on the surface.</p><h2>Zhurong's challenges and prospects</h2><p>Zhurong faced many challenges during its exploration, such as extreme temperatures, rough terrain, sandstorms and communication delays. The rover had to rely on solar energy to power its systems and instruments, which made it vulnerable to changes in weather and seasons.</p><p>In May 2022, Zhurong entered a planned sleep mode as the Martian winter approached. The solar radiation reaching the rover's location decreased significantly, reducing its power generation capacity. The rover was expected to wake up in December 2022 when the light and temperature conditions improved.</p><p>However, Zhurong did not resume communication with Earth as expected. Zhang Rongqiao said that the most likely reason was that an "unpredictable accumulation" of dust had covered the rover's solar panels, making it impossible for the robot to power up. He said that the rover needed at least 140 watts of electricity to wake up and operate normally.</p><p>Zhang Rongqiao said that there was still a chance that Zhurong could revive itself if the dust accumulation did not exceed 40% and if the temperature inside the cabin rose above -15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit). He said that the rover would automatically wake up when these conditions were met.</p><p>However, he also acknowledged that there was a possibility that Zhurong might never exit hibernation if the dust accumulation was too severe or if other technical problems occurred. He said that the rover's dormancy was "within our expectation" and that it had completed its primary mission successfully.</p><p>Zhurong is not the only spacecraft that has faced difficulties on Mars due to dust storms. NASA's Opportunity rover, which landed on Mars in 2004 and operated for nearly 15 years, lost contact with Earth in June 2018 after a global dust storm blocked its solar panels. NASA declared Opportunity's mission over in February 2019 after failing to reestablish communication.</p><p>NASA's InSight lander, which landed on Mars in 2018 and studied the planet's interior structure and seismic activity, also suffered from reduced power generation due to dust accumulation on its solar panels. NASA announced in December 2021 that InSight's mission had ended after it failed to respond to commands.</p><p>On the other hand, NASA's Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter, which landed on Mars in February 2021 as part of the Mars 2020 mission, have survived the Martian winter and continued their exploration. Perseverance has been searching for signs of ancient microbial life and collecting rock samples for future return to Earth. Ingenuity has been demonstrating the feasibility of powered flight on another planet and assisting Perseverance with aerial reconnaissance.</p><h2>The future of China's Mars exploration</h2><p>Despite Zhurong's uncertain fate, China has not given up on its ambitions to explore Mars. Zhang Rongqiao said that China planned to launch more missions to Mars in the future, including a sample-return mission by the end of 2030 and a crewed mission by 2033.</p><p>China aims to send its first crewed mission to Mars in 2033, with regular follow-up flights to follow, under a long-term plan to build a permanently inhabited base on the Red Planet and extract its resources. The plan will intensify a race with the United States, which also has a goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s.</p><p>To achieve this vision, China will have to develop new technologies and capabilities, such as nuclear propulsion, advanced life support systems, in-situ resource utilization and interplanetary communication. China will also have to overcome the challenges of long-duration spaceflight, such as radiation exposure, psychological stress and health risks.</p><p>China's crewed mission to Mars will require fleets of spacecraft shuttling between Earth and Mars and major development of the planet's resources. To shorten the travel time, spacecraft will have to tap energy released from nuclear reactions in the form of heat and electricity, in addition to traditional chemical propellants.</p><p>China's Mars exploration program is part of its broader strategy to become a leading space power and challenge U.S. dominance in space. China is also planning to set up a base in the south pole of the Moon and launch robotic expeditions to asteroids and Jupiter around 2030.</p><p>China's achievements in space have been hailed by its leaders and citizens as a source of national pride and prestige. They have also raised concerns among some countries, especially the United States, about China's intentions and capabilities in space.</p><p>China has insisted that its space activities are peaceful and beneficial for all mankind. It has also expressed its willingness to cooperate with other countries on space exploration, as long as they respect China's interests and sovereignty.</p><h6>China, Mars, Zhurong, rover, dust storm</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
