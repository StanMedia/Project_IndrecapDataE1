It would not touch retirement and health programs that are projected to expand dramatically as the population ages.</p><p>President Joe Biden and the Democratic-controlled Senate are likely to reject the proposals, but McCarthy said they would serve as the basis for negotiations between the two parties over raising the federal government's $31.4 trillion debt limit in the coming weeks.</p><p>Failure to raise the debt ceiling would lead to default that would shake the U.S. and world economies.</p><p>"President Biden has a choice: Come to the table and stop playing partisan political games, or cover his ears, refuse to negotiate and risk bumbling his way into the first default in our nation's history," McCarthy said on the House floor.</p><p>He did not say when the House of Representatives, which his Republicans control by a narrow 222-213 majority, would vote on the plan.</p><p>Biden reiterated his position that Congress should raise the $31.4 trillion debt limit without conditions, as it did three times under his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.</p><h2>McCarthy's plan targets Biden's agenda</h2><p>McCarthy's plan would also repeal green-energy incentives signed into law by Biden last year, boost domestic oil and gas production and scrap his $400 billion student-loan forgiveness effort.</p><p>It would claw back unspent COVID-19 relief money, cancel a recent budget increase for the Internal Revenue Service and impose stiffer work requirements for some benefit programs.</p><p>Congress would gain greater power to block Biden administration regulations under the proposal as well.</p><p>McCarthy said the package would lower spending by $4.5 trillion over the coming 10 years. That would not be enough to eliminate budget deficits that are projected to add more than $20 trillion to the national debt over that time period.</p><p>Democrats have criticized McCarthy's plan as a partisan attempt to undermine Biden's agenda and hurt millions of Americans who rely on federal programs and services.</p><p>They have also argued that raising the debt ceiling is a necessary and routine step to pay for past spending decisions that both parties agreed on, not a license to increase future spending.</p><h6>U.S., debt ceiling, Kevin McCarthy, Joe Biden</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
