As her novels are adapted for the screen, we explore why they endure.</p><h2>Judy Blume's books tackled taboo topics with honesty and humor</h2><p>When Pip Harry first got her period at 11, her mother handed her pads and a copy of Judy Blume's "Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret."</p><p>The seminal coming-of-age novel, which tells the story of sixth grader Margaret Simon who's anxious for her body to mature and conflicted about religion, has been a cultural touchstone for generations of girls and women.</p><p>Harry's mother read it when it was first published in 1970 before sharing it with preteen Harry in the '80s. The book's straightforward account of puberty felt radical, and Harry breezed through the whole book in one sitting.</p><p>"It was a very frank portrayal of what it was like to be a teenager," Harry, who lives in Sydney and is now a young adult author, said during a phone interview.</p><p>A few years ago, Harry decided to reread the novel — this time with her own 11-year-old daughter. Harry was struck by how strong the voice of protagonist Margaret was, and while her daughter was put off by some plot points around bullying and gender roles, she thought the book was sweet and could relate to Margaret's spiritual uncertainty.</p><p>Kelly Fremon Craig's film adaptation of "Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret" hits U.S. theaters this weekend, transporting longtime fans back to their childhoods and introducing a whole new crop of young people to Blume's perceptive characters.</p><p>"Margaret" isn't the only Blume title being adapted for our screens. Her adult novel "Summer Sisters" is set to become a Hulu limited series, the children's classic "Superfudge" is being adapted into an animated film for Disney+ and the young adult novel "Forever" is being reimagined for Netflix. Meanwhile, "Judy Blume Forever," a documentary that explores author's life and impact on pop culture, was released last week on Amazon Prime Video.</p><p>This Judy Blume renaissance is a testament to her enduring popularity. Her frank and straightforward portrayals of young people have captivated the attention of countless readers. Her books have sold more than 90 million copies globally. And though a lot has changed for young people in the decades since beloved titles such as "Margaret," "Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing" and "Tiger Eyes" first hit shelves, kids and teenagers are still reaching for her books.</p><p>Blume didn't shy away from taboo topics such as periods, masturbation, sex, divorce, bullying and death. She wrote with honesty and humor, without talking down to her audience or sugarcoating reality. She also gave voice to the inner thoughts and feelings of her characters, making them relatable and authentic.</p><p>Blume's characters talked openly about periods and female sexual pleasure, and expressed thoughts both mundane and profound. The way she depicted the interior lives of girls was revolutionary at a time when most children's literature focused on boys' adventures or moral lessons.</p><p>"She was one of the first authors who really spoke to kids in their own language," said Jennifer Hubert Swan, director of library services at Little Red School House &amp; Elisabeth Irwin High School in New York City.</p><p>"She really understood what kids were going through emotionally and psychologically. She didn't shy away from anything that kids were curious about or worried about."</p><h2>Judy Blume faced censorship and controversy</h2><p>Not everyone appreciated Blume's candid approach to writing for young people. Her books have been frequently challenged or banned by parents, teachers and librarians who deemed them inappropriate or immoral.</p><p>According to the American Library Association (ALA), Blume is one of the most frequently challenged authors of the 21st century. Four of her books — "Forever," "Blubber," "Deenie" and "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret" — made the ALA's list of top 100 most frequently challenged books from 1990 to 1999.</p><p>Blume has been outspoken about defending her work and fighting against censorship. She has also supported other authors whose books have been targeted by censors.</p><p>In an essay for The Guardian in 2014, Blume wrote that she was shocked when she first learned that some people wanted to ban her books.</p><p>"I had no idea this could happen in a democracy. I thought I was living in a country where everyone was free to choose the books they wanted to read," she wrote.</p><p>"I began to hear from kids, teachers and librarians who were fighting to keep my books on the shelves. They wrote to tell me what was happening in their communities and to ask for help. I soon learned that it wasn't only my books but those of many other authors as well."</p><p>Blume said she realized that censorship was not only about books, but also about ideas and issues that some people found uncomfortable or threatening.</p><p>"They were issues I cared about deeply: family, friendship, puberty, racism, sexuality, love, identity, death. These are the things I write about — the things that matter most to me and to my readers," she wrote.</p><p>Blume said she was grateful for the support she received from her readers and fellow writers, as well as organizations such as the National Coalition Against Censorship and the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom.</p><p>She also said she hoped that her books would inspire young people to think for themselves and to speak up for their rights.</p><p>"I believe that censorship grows out of fear, and because fear is contagious, some parents are easily swayed. Book banning satisfies their need to feel in control of their children's lives. This fear is often disguised as moral outrage. They want to believe that if their children don't read about it, their children won't know about it. And if they don't know about it, it won't happen," she wrote.</p><h2>Judy Blume's books resonate with young readers today</h2><p>Despite the controversy and censorship, Blume's books have remained popular and relevant among young readers today.</p><p>Teachers and librarians said Blume's novels continue to resonate with young people because they address universal themes and emotions that transcend time and place.</p><p>"Kids still go through puberty, kids still have questions about sex, kids still have family issues, kids still have friendship issues," said Swan, the librarian in New York City.</p><p>"Her books are timeless because they really get to the heart of what it means to be a kid."</p><p>Swan said she has seen students of different ages and backgrounds pick up Blume's books and connect with them.</p><p>"Some kids read them because their parents read them and they want to share that experience. Some kids read them because they're curious about what life was like before cell phones and social media. Some kids read them because they're looking for answers or comfort or guidance," she said.</p><p>Swan said she also uses Blume's books as a way to spark discussions with her students about how society has changed or stayed the same since the books were written.</p><p>"We talk about how gender roles have evolved, how diversity and inclusion have improved, how technology has transformed communication and relationships," she said.</p><p>"We also talk about how some things haven't changed much, like peer pressure, body image, bullying, racism and sexism."</p><p>Swan said she hopes that Blume's books will continue to inspire young people to be themselves and to embrace their differences.</p><p>"I think Judy Blume's books teach kids that it's okay to be imperfect, it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to have questions," she said.</p><p>"She shows them that they're not alone in their struggles and joys. She shows them that they can grow and learn from their experiences. She shows them that they can be brave and strong and kind."</p><h6>Judy Blume, books, young readers, adaptation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
