New research suggests there is a golden hour for different types of cancer</h1><p><img src=https://a1.indrecap.com/0/00186.webp height=281 class=antiCLS /></p><p class=imgCredit>Ivan Samkov/pexels</p><p>A new study reveals that some cancers are more likely to metastasize or respond to treatment at certain times of the day</p><h2>What is chronotherapy?</h2><p>Chronotherapy is the idea that timing medical interventions according to the body's circadian rhythms can improve their effectiveness and reduce their side effects. Circadian rhythms are the natural cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes that follow a 24-hour pattern, influenced by light and darkness. They affect many aspects of our health, such as sleep, hormone levels, metabolism and immune system.</p><p>Chronotherapy has been applied to various diseases, such as asthma, depression, hypertension and diabetes. However, one of the most promising areas of chronotherapy is cancer. Cancer cells have abnormal circadian rhythms that make them more vulnerable or resistant to treatment at certain times of the day. By synchronizing the administration of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy with the optimal time window for each type of cancer, chronotherapy can potentially enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of these treatments.</p><h2>The golden hour for different cancers</h2><p>A recent study by researchers from Taiwan and China has identified several types of cancer that have specific time windows for metastasis or treatment. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications on June 4, 2021.</p><p>The researchers analyzed data from over 20 million cancer patients in Taiwan and China between 2000 and 2016. They used a statistical method called cosinor analysis to detect periodic patterns in cancer incidence, mortality and survival. They found that some cancers had significant circadian variations in these outcomes.</p><p>For example, they discovered that kidney cancer patients who underwent surgery before 4:30 pm had better survival rates than those who underwent surgery after 4:30 pm. They also found that breast cancer patients who were diagnosed at night had higher risks of metastasis than those who were diagnosed during the day. Moreover, they observed that colorectal cancer patients who received chemotherapy in the morning had lower mortality rates than those who received chemotherapy in the afternoon.</p><p>The researchers speculated that these findings could be explained by the interactions between circadian rhythms and tumor biology. For instance, they suggested that kidney cancer cells might be more sensitive to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the afternoon, which could trigger angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) and promote tumor growth. Therefore, removing the tumor before 4:30 pm could prevent this process and improve survival.</p><p>Similarly, they proposed that breast cancer cells might express higher levels of estrogen receptors at night, which could enhance their invasiveness and metastatic potential. Therefore, diagnosing breast cancer during the day could allow for earlier intervention and better prognosis.</p><p>Furthermore, they hypothesized that colorectal cancer cells might have lower levels of DNA repair enzymes in the morning, which could make them more susceptible to DNA damage induced by chemotherapy. Therefore, administering chemotherapy in the morning could increase its effectiveness and reduce its side effects.</p><h2>Implications and limitations</h2><p>The study provides novel insights into the role of circadian rhythms in cancer development and treatment. It suggests that chronotherapy could be a useful strategy to optimize the outcomes of cancer patients by tailoring the timing of diagnosis and therapy to each type of cancer.</p><p>However, the study also has some limitations that need to be addressed. First, it is an observational study that cannot establish causal relationships between circadian variations and cancer outcomes. Second, it does not account for other factors that might influence circadian rhythms and cancer outcomes, such as genetic variations, environmental factors, lifestyle habits and comorbidities. Third, it does not provide mechanistic explanations for how circadian rhythms affect tumor biology and how chronotherapy works at the molecular level.</p><p>Therefore, more research is needed to confirm and explain the findings of this study and to translate them into clinical practice. Chronotherapy is still an emerging field that requires further investigation and validation before it can be widely adopted as a standard of care for cancer patients.</p><h6>Chronotherapy, Circadian rhythms, Cancer treatment</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
