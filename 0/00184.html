Over-reliance on laxatives may cause colon paralysis and worsen constipation</h1><p><img src=https://a1.indrecap.com/0/00184.webp height=281 class=antiCLS /></p><p class=imgCredit>StockSnap/Pixabay</p><p>A comprehensive report on the causes, symptoms and treatments of constipation, based on a Taiwanese health article.</p><h2>What is constipation and how common is it?</h2><p>Constipation is a condition where the stool becomes hard and dry, making it difficult or painful to pass. It can also cause bloating, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite and fatigue. Constipation is not a disease, but a symptom of various factors that affect the bowel movement.</p><p>According to a survey by the Taiwan Society of Coloproctology, about 25% of Taiwanese adults suffer from constipation, and the prevalence is higher among women, elderly and people with low-fiber diets. Constipation can also be caused by stress, lack of exercise, dehydration, medication side effects, pregnancy, hormonal changes, bowel diseases and other medical conditions.</p><h2>Why is constipation harmful and how can it be prevented?</h2><p>Constipation can have serious consequences if left untreated. It can lead to hemorrhoids, anal fissures, fecal impaction, diverticulitis and colon cancer. Constipation can also affect the quality of life and mental health of the sufferers.</p><p>The best way to prevent constipation is to adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes eating more fiber-rich foods, drinking enough water, exercising regularly, managing stress and establishing a regular bowel habit. Fiber can help soften the stool and increase its bulk, making it easier to pass. Water can help hydrate the stool and prevent dehydration. Exercise can stimulate the intestinal muscles and improve blood circulation. Stress can affect the nervous system and cause intestinal spasms or slow down the bowel movement. A regular bowel habit can train the body to have a natural rhythm of defecation.</p><h2>When should laxatives be used and what are the risks?</h2><p>Laxatives are medications that help stimulate or facilitate the bowel movement. They are usually prescribed by doctors for short-term use when other methods fail to relieve constipation. However, some people may abuse laxatives for weight loss or other reasons, or become dependent on them for long-term use.</p><p>Overuse or misuse of laxatives can have serious side effects, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, kidney damage and colon paralysis. Colon paralysis is a condition where the colon loses its ability to contract and move the stool along. This can result in chronic constipation that is resistant to treatment.</p><p>Therefore, laxatives should only be used as a last resort and under medical supervision. They should not be taken for more than two weeks without consulting a doctor. They should also be used in conjunction with other lifestyle changes that address the root causes of constipation.</p><h6>Constipation, Laxatives, Colon Paralysis</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
