The trust of the people is the biggest driving force for me to move forward, and also a heavy responsibility on my shoulders," he said.</p><p>Like his many previous speeches, Xi struck a nationalist tone, citing the hardships China suffered at the hands of "bullying foreign powers" in the modern era and noting how the Communist Party has led the country to "wipe clean the national humiliation."</p><p>"The Chinese people have become the masters of their own destiny," he said. "The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process."</p><h2>Xi Jinping reiterates Taiwan stance amid rising fears of conflict</h2><p>According to Xi, the "essence" of that rejuvenation is "national unification," namely "reunifying" Taiwan with mainland China. The Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and refuses to rule out the use of force.</p><p>Under Xi, Beijing has ramped up economic, diplomatic and military pressure on the island democracy. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Beijing has not condemned, has also increased fears Xi might look to do something similar in the years ahead.</p><p>"We must... actively promote peaceful development of cross-strait relations, firmly oppose interference of external forces and Taiwan's separatist activities, and resolutely advance the process of national reunification," Xi said to a loud burst of applause in the Great Hall of the People.</p><p>Xi also called for China to better coordinate development and security.</p><p>"Security is the foundation for development, stability is the prerequisite for prosperity," he said.</p><h2>China's new premier strikes a more conciliatory tone with US</h2><p>Xi's focus on security comes as relations with the US have hit their lowest point in decades. China's new foreign minister warned during the congress that Washington's efforts to contain Beijing's interests could drive the rival superpowers towards "conflict and confrontation."</p><p>Newly appointed premier Li Qiang, Beijing's number two, struck a more conciliatory tone in his first press conference, saying China and the US were closely intertwined economically to the benefit of both sides.</p><p>"Some have been trumpeting the idea of decoupling with China... but I wonder how many people can truly benefit from this hype," Li said on Monday. "Encirclement and suppression are in no one's interest."</p><p>Li also sought to reassure China's business community, which was hit hard by Covid-19 lockdowns last year, as well as defuse concerns about the administration backtracking to a state-led economy.</p><p>"Governments at all levels should make friends with entrepreneurs, build a friendly business environment and care about private entrepreneurs," he said.</p><p>The premier admitted that with business still finding its footing, even hitting the country's 5 per cent economic growth target for this year would "not be an easy task" and "require redoubled efforts".</p><h6>Xi Jinping, China, military, Taiwan</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
