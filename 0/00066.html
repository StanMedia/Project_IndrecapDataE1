Authorities located 8,640 kilograms (9.5 US tons) of the drug using sniffer dogs and a chemical identification system, after inspecting a container housing 960 boxes and the tequila bottles at the port of Manzanillo – a city on the western coast of Mexico.</p><p>Samples were then taken to a navy laboratory for further analysis where they were confirmed to be meth, and the drugs were seized. Already this year, the navy has seized and destroyed approximately 114 tons of meth, its statement noted.</p><p>Photos of the seizure show a sniffer dog alerting inspectors to cardboard boxes of glass bottles full of a brownish liquid, consistent with the color of "añejo" or aged tequila. The labels on the bottles were not visible in the video. Mexico is the world’s only producer of authentic tequila.</p><h2>A dangerous substance</h2><p>Meth is a highly addictive stimulant that usually takes the form of a powder or crystals, although it is often dissolved into solutions to make it harder to detect during transport before it is made into crystals again for consumption. In 2021, more than 32,000 Americans died from overdoses involving psychostimulants, primarily meth, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>It is not the first time that authorities have seized meth hidden in creative ways. Australian border officials found $1 million worth of liquid meth inside snow globes in 2019. Meanwhile, US border officials found about $266,000 worth of liquid meth inside the gas tank of a truck in 2020.</p><p>The liquid meth is usually recovered by the smugglers and taken to specialized facilities where the water is extracted and the drug is returned to its usually crystal form for sale or consumption.</p><h2>A global problem</h2><p>Mexico has become a major producer of meth, and drug smugglers frequently are stopped at the border when liquid meth is found in their windshield washer fluid or other containers in their cars. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Mexico accounted for 42% of global seizures of methamphetamine in 2019.</p><p>The UNODC also reported that methamphetamine trafficking routes have diversified in recent years, with shipments originating from Mexico reaching new destinations such as Europe, Asia and Oceania. The agency warned that methamphetamine poses a serious threat to public health and security worldwide, as it is associated with violence, crime and environmental damage.</p><h2>Drugs and tequila</h2><p>Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from blue agave plants grown mainly in Jalisco state and some surrounding areas in Mexico. It has a distinctive flavor and aroma that varies depending on the type and quality of tequila. Tequila can be classified into five categories: blanco (white), joven (young), reposado (rested), añejo (aged) and extra añejo (extra aged).</p><p>Tequila has a long history and cultural significance in Mexico, where it is considered a national drink and a symbol of identity. Tequila is also popular around the world, especially in North America and Europe, where it is often consumed as shots with salt and lime or mixed with other ingredients to make cocktails such as margaritas.</p><p>However, tequila can also be used as a disguise or a solvent for illicit drugs such as methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a synthetic drug that stimulates the central nervous system and increases alertness, energy, euphoria and libido. It can also cause paranoia, psychosis, aggression, anxiety and addiction. Methamphetamine can be smoked, snorted, injected or swallowed.</p><p>Methamphetamine can be dissolved in water or other liquids such as alcohol to make it easier to transport or conceal. Some smugglers use tequila bottles or other containers to hide liquid meth from authorities or customers. However, this poses a serious risk for anyone who accidentally or intentionally consumes the contaminated tequila, as it can cause severe intoxication, overdose or death.</p><h6>Mexico, Methamphetamine, Tequila</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
