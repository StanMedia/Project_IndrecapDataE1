This level of support has been consistent since 2018, after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.</p><p>The poll also finds broad support for specific gun control proposals, such as preventing people under the age of 21 from buying any type of gun (80%), banning semi-automatic rifles (59%), and requiring background checks for all gun buyers (94%).</p><p>In addition, 94% of Americans say they favor preventing convicted felons and those with mental health problems from owning guns, and 58% say they believe the government and society can take effective action to prevent mass shootings.</p><h2>Public split on whether guns make public places safer or less safe</h2><p>However, the poll also reveals a close divide among Americans on how the availability of guns affects public safety. About one-third of Americans (36%) say that the presence of guns makes public places less safe, while another third (32%) say that allowing gun owners to carry their guns in public makes those places safer. The remaining third (31%) say it makes no difference to safety.</p><p>The poll also shows that only 54% of Americans believe that having stricter gun control laws would reduce the number of gun-related deaths in the country, while 45% say they would not.</p><p>These views vary widely by party affiliation, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to favor stricter gun laws, to think that guns make public places less safe, and to believe that stricter laws would reduce gun deaths. Independents are somewhere in between the two parties on these issues.</p><h2>Poll conducted amid anniversary of Uvalde school shooting</h2><p>The CNN poll was conducted from May 17 to May 20, 2023, among a random national sample of 1,227 adults. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.</p><p>The poll was released on Friday, May 26, 2023, as President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced a tentative deal to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default.</p><p>The poll also coincided with the one-year anniversary of the Uvalde school shooting, which killed 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on May 25, 2022. The shooting was one of the deadliest mass shootings in US history and sparked renewed calls for action on gun violence.</p><p>Biden marked the anniversary by calling on Congress to pass his gun control agenda, which includes banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, establishing universal background checks and red flag laws, and ending immunity for gun manufacturers.</p><h6>CNN poll, gun control, public safety, Uvalde shooting</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
