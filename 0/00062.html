The rocket, called TEXUS-58, was part of a European program commissioned by the European Space Agency (ESA) to conduct experiments in microgravity.</p><p>The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), which operates the Esrange Space Center, said the rocket entered a "non-nominal flight path," taking a longer and more westerly trajectory than calculated. It landed in a forested area that lies 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the planned landing site.</p><p>The rocket's payload, which contained three scientific experiments, was recovered on Tuesday in good condition and transported by helicopter back to the Esrange Space Center.</p><h2>Why did it happen?</h2><p>SSC said it was investigating the reason why the rocket flew off course and that it was too early to speculate about the cause. The company said it took the deviation seriously and that it was awaiting more information from the current investigation.</p><p>SSC also said it had informed Norwegian authorities about the incident and that it had followed all safety procedures during the launch and recovery operations.</p><h2>What were the experiments?</h2><p>The TEXUS-58 rocket reached an altitude of 250 kilometers (155 miles) where it performed three experiments in zero gravity for about six minutes. The experiments were part of research investigating how planets form and testing materials to improve the efficiency of solar cells and engines.</p><p>One of the experiments, called DUSTY-2, aimed to study how dust particles interact with each other under different conditions, such as temperature and electric charge. This could help scientists understand how planets form from dust grains in protoplanetary disks around young stars.</p><p>Another experiment, called SOLARX-2, tested a new material called perovskite that could be used to make more efficient solar cells. Perovskite has a high light absorption capacity and can be produced at low cost, but it is also sensitive to environmental factors such as humidity and oxygen. The experiment examined how perovskite behaves in space and whether it can withstand harsh conditions.</p><p>The third experiment, called PULSAR-2, measured the performance of a new type of engine that uses pulsed plasma thrusters. These thrusters generate thrust by ionizing gas and accelerating it with electric fields. They are suitable for small satellites that need precise attitude control and orbital maneuvers. The experiment tested how the thrusters operate in vacuum and how they affect the surrounding environment.</p><h2>How often does this happen?</h2><p>This is not the first time that a rocket launched from Esrange has landed in the wrong country. In 2016, a Russian rocket carrying a German satellite crashed in Norway after a technical failure. The satellite was part of a mission to study the Earth's magnetic field and its interaction with solar wind. The rocket was supposed to reach an orbit of 500 kilometers (310 miles), but instead plunged into the Barents Sea near Spitsbergen. No one was injured in the incident, but the satellite was lost.</p><p>Esrange Space Center was established in 1964 by the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), which later became part of the European Space Agency (ESA). The facility is located about 40 kilometers east of the town of Kiruna in northern Sweden, above the Arctic Circle. It has access to a vast, unpopulated impact and recovery area that covers parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia. Esrange is used for launching sounding rockets for microgravity and atmospheric research, as well as high-altitude balloons for astronomy and drop tests. It also hosts one of the world's largest civilian satellite ground stations and acts as a hub for SSC's satellite station network.</p><h6>Sweden, Norway, rocket, ESA</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
