"No person or ideology that evokes the dictatorship should be honored or extolled there."</p><p>The son of dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, who governed Spain from 1923-1930, Jose Antonio was shot by firing squad in November 1936 by left-wing Republican forces in Alicante.</p><p>It was the fifth time his body has been buried and the fourth time it has been exhumed. In 1939, after having lain in two different mass graves in Alicante, his coffin was paraded 500 kilometers (311 miles) from the eastern coastal city to San Lorenzo de El Escorial, a town near Madrid where Spain's royals are buried.</p><p>His remains were moved again on the completion of Valley of the Fallen monument 20 years later and buried under the altar of the basilica, where Franco would join him on his death in 1975.</p><h2>A tense transfer</h2><p>Police struggled to hold back a crowd of about 150 Falange supporters gathered outside the San Isidro cemetery in southern Madrid, where he was taken to be reburied. They gave the fascist salute and sang the Falangist hymn "Facing the sun."</p><p>The three arrests were for public disorder, according to a police source.</p><p>Some protesters shouted "traitors" and "cowards" at government officials overseeing the transfer. Others held banners reading "Jose Antonio lives" and "Spain will not be broken."</p><p>The exhumation was carried out discreetly and early in the morning to avoid clashes with Primo de Rivera's followers. The government had also banned any demonstrations or gatherings near the mausoleum or the cemetery.</p><p>The family of Primo de Rivera had opposed his exhumation and had requested that he be reburied in a family vault at another cemetery in Madrid. However, a court rejected their appeal and authorized his transfer to San Isidro.</p><h2>A historical revision</h2><p>Franco, a conservative general, and Primo de Rivera, a flamboyant playboy, had little love for each other, according to Franco's biographer Paul Preston.</p><p>Franco in fact sabotaged several efforts to organize a rescue or a prisoner swap that would have saved Primo de Rivera's life, Preston wrote in his biography.</p><p>His death allowed Franco to eliminate a rival and take control of the Falangists, subsuming them to a broader far-right movement that supported his dictatorship.</p><p>The government is currently carrying out works in the mausoleum to permit access to the crypts where 34,000 people's remains, many of them victims of Franco's regime, are buried anonymously, allowing families to identify their relatives.</p><p>The Democratic Memory law also aims to remove Francoist symbols from public spaces, grant reparations to victims of political repression and human rights violations during and after the civil war, and revoke honors and titles granted by Franco.</p><p>The law has been praised by human rights groups and left-wing parties as a necessary step to heal historical wounds and recognize those who suffered under Franco's rule.</p><p>However, it has also been criticized by some right-wing parties and groups as an attempt to rewrite history and fuel political polarization.</p><h6>Spain, fascism, exhumation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
