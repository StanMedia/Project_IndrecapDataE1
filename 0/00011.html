"More severe droughts, more floods, seas rising temperatures, rising weather, instability, market unpredictability."</p><p>Biden also pledged $1 billion in new funding to the United Nations's Green Climate Fund to help developing countries fight climate change, noting that those countries often bear the most deleterious effects of climate change even though they contribute the least to the problem.</p><p>"As large economies and large emitters, we must step up and support these economies," he said.</p><h2>Biden offers $500 million to Brazil for Amazon protection</h2><p>One of the most significant announcements Biden made was his pledge to contribute $500 million over the next five years to the Amazon Fund, Brazil's effort to end deforestation of the Amazon rainforest by 2030.</p><p>"Today, I'm pleased to announce that I will request the funds so that we can contribute $500 million to the Amazon Fund and other climate-related activities over the next five years to support Brazil's renewed effort to end deforestation by 2030," Biden said.</p><p>The Amazon Fund uses foreign funds for projects that fight deforestation and preserve the environment in the Amazon, and was set up in Brazil during President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's previous term in office. Major donors include Norway and Germany.</p><p>During the presidency of former Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, the fund was left untouched while then-environmental minister Ricardo Salles dissolved committees responsible for managing the resource.</p><p>Lula has touted curbing deforestation of the Amazon as a top priority since becoming president earlier this year. He has also pledged to reduce Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.</p><p>Biden's offer of aid is seen as a gesture of goodwill and cooperation with Lula amid recent tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and relations with China. Biden also welcomed Colombian President Gustavo Petro to the White House on Thursday, saying he considers Colombia "the key to the hemisphere," in efforts to ensure the Western Hemisphere is "united, equal, democratic, and economically prosperous."</p><h2>Biden urges other countries to follow suit</h2><p>Biden credited the Inflation Reduction Act and a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, both of which he signed into law, as measures that would help the United States meet its goals. Through those laws, the country was investing billions to scale-up clean energy technologies and bolstering the electric vehicle industry, he said.</p><p>Biden also urged other countries to follow his example and increase their climate ambitions ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November.</p><p>"We're at a moment of great peril but also great possibilities, serious possibilities. With the right commitment and follow-through from every nation on this call, the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees can stay within reach," he said.</p><p>The meeting Thursday morning was the fourth time the MEF has convened during Biden's time in office. The group was launched in 2009 and now includes Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p><h6>Biden, Brazil, Amazon Fund</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
