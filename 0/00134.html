The evacuations began on Friday and continued over the weekend, amid rumors of an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive to reclaim the southern region.</p><p>Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed acting governor of the partially occupied region, said the evacuations were a "necessary measure" due to "intensified shelling of settlements" close to the front line. He said the evacuees were moved "deep into the region" and provided with food, water, and medical assistance.</p><p>However, Ukraine has accused Russia of using the evacuations as a cover to withdraw its soldiers from the front lines, disguised as civilians. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Russia was "trying to escape responsibility for its crimes" and called on the international community to "condemn this cynical manipulation."</p><h2>Nuclear plant safety at risk</h2><p>The evacuations have also raised concerns about the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest nuclear power station, which is located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river in the occupied region. The plant is held by Russian forces but mostly operated by a Ukrainian workforce.</p><p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday that the situation in the area near the plant "is becoming increasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerous." The IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said he was deeply concerned about the "increasingly tense, stressful, and challenging conditions" for personnel and their families and about "the very real nuclear safety and security risks facing the plant."</p><p>"We must act now to prevent the threat of a severe nuclear accident and its associated consequences for the population and the environment," Grossi warned.</p><p>The town of Enerhodar, where most of the plant's staff live, was among 18 settlements whose residents were evacuated over the weekend. The site director Yuri Chernichuk said operating staff were not being evacuated and "are doing everything necessary to ensure nuclear safety and security at the plant."</p><p>Chernichuk said the plant's six reactors were all in shutdown mode and its equipment was being maintained, "in accordance with all necessary nuclear safety and security regulations," according to Grossi.</p><p>The plant's position on the front lines means shelling in the surrounding towns and near the facility is common, according to local reports. It has frequently been disconnected from Ukraine's power grid due to intense Russian shelling in the area, repeatedly raising fears across Europe of a nuclear accident.</p><p>The plant is also significant because Ukraine relies heavily on nuclear power. Should Russia keep it, Ukraine would lose 20% of its domestic electricity generating capacity. Analysts have said Russia would want to capture the plant undamaged, with hopes of serving its own electricity market.</p><p>The IAEA said experts at the site continue to hear shelling on a regular basis, including late on Friday.</p><h2>Background of the conflict</h2><p>The conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalated in January 2023, when Russia launched a large-scale invasion of eastern and southern Ukraine, following months of military buildup along their border. Russia claimed it was protecting Russian-speaking minorities from Ukrainian aggression, while Ukraine denounced it as an act of war and a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>The international community condemned Russia's actions and imposed sanctions on Moscow, while also providing diplomatic and military support to Kyiv. The United States, NATO, and other allies have sent troops, weapons, and aid to Ukraine, while also urging for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p><p>Despite several attempts at mediation and ceasefire agreements, the fighting has continued unabated, with both sides accusing each other of violating human rights and international law. The UN estimates that more than 10,000 people have been killed and over one million displaced since January 2023.</p><h6>Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Russia-Ukraine conflict, IAEA</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
