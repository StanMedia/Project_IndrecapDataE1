The operation, codenamed "Eureka", involved more than 1,000 officers and dozens of raids in Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain.</p><p>The operation was coordinated by Eurojust, the European Union's agency for judicial cooperation, and supported by Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency. It was based on a four-year investigation led by the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office and the Limburg Prosecutor's Office, in collaboration with other authorities.</p><p>The operation aimed to dismantle the 'Ndrangheta's network of drug trafficking and money laundering across Europe and beyond. The 'Ndrangheta is based in Calabria, a region in southern Italy, but has expanded its operations to other countries and continents. It is estimated to control 80% of Europe's cocaine market and to have an annual turnover of more than 50 billion euros ($60 billion).</p><h2>The arrests</h2><p>According to Eurojust, more than 130 people were arrested during the operation, including suspected members and associates of the 'Ndrangheta. They are accused of various crimes, such as mafia-type association, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, tax evasion and possession of weapons.</p><p>In Italy, the Carabinieri arrested 108 people suspected of being involved with the 'Ndrangheta. They also seized assets worth more than 10 million euros ($12 million), including cash, cars, properties and businesses.</p><p>In Germany, more than 30 people were arrested in several states, including North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Thuringia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. They are suspected of co-financing cocaine smuggling and laundering money through restaurants, pizzerias and cafes.</p><p>In Belgium, more than 20 raids were carried out in Limburg province and other locations. The Belgian authorities said they uncovered a connection between a pizzeria in Genk and the 'Ndrangheta in 2019, which triggered the investigation.</p><p>In France, Portugal and Spain, several people were also arrested and searched as part of the operation. The authorities did not provide further details about their involvement.</p><h2>The reaction</h2><p>The European authorities hailed the operation as a major success and a blow to the 'Ndrangheta. They also stressed the importance of international cooperation and coordination in fighting organized crime.</p><p>"This operation shows that we can only fight against organized crime together," said Filippo Spiezia, vice president of Eurojust. "We have to join forces at European level to tackle this phenomenon that knows no borders."</p><p>"This is a clear example of how Europol can support member states in tackling serious and organized crime," said Catherine De Bolle, executive director of Europol. "By working together across borders and disciplines we can make Europe safer."</p><p>The Italian authorities also praised the operation and said it confirmed their commitment to fight against the 'Ndrangheta. "This is a great result that demonstrates the strength of our cooperation with our European partners," said Franco Gabrielli, chief of Italian police. "We will continue to work together to combat this dangerous criminal organization."</p><h2>The Anti-Mafia Directorate</h2><p>The Anti-Mafia Directorate (DIA) is a special agency of the Italian Ministry of Interior that coordinates the fight against organized crime, especially the mafia. It was established in 1991, following a decade of violence and corruption by the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, the Campanian Camorra, and the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta.</p><p>The DIA is composed of officers from different law enforcement agencies, such as the State Police, the Carabinieri, the Financial Police, and the Penitentiary Police. It operates under the supervision of the National Anti-Mafia Prosecutor, who oversees all investigations and prosecutions related to mafia crimes.</p><p>The DIA has a central office in Rome and 26 local offices across Italy. It also cooperates with foreign authorities and international organizations, such as Eurojust and Europol, to combat transnational organized crime.</p><p>The DIA's main tasks are to collect, analyze, and share information on mafia activities; to support and coordinate investigations and operations against mafia groups; to protect witnesses and collaborators of justice; and to prevent and seize mafia assets.</p><p>The DIA has been involved in several major operations against the mafia, such as Operation Old Bridge in 2008, which targeted the Gambino crime family in New York and its links with the Cosa Nostra; Operation Minotauro in 2010, which dismantled a powerful 'Ndrangheta clan in northern Italy; and Operation Eureka in 2023, which resulted in more than 130 arrests across Europe.</p><h2>The aftermath</h2><p>The operation Eureka was hailed as a significant achievement by the European authorities and a severe blow to the 'Ndrangheta. However, it also raised some challenges and questions for the future.</p><p>One of the challenges is to ensure that the arrested suspects are brought to justice and face fair trials. According to Eurojust, some of them will be extradited to Italy or other countries where they are wanted for other crimes. Others will be prosecuted in their countries of residence, according to their national laws.</p><p>Another challenge is to prevent the 'Ndrangheta from regenerating and reorganizing its network after the operation. According to some experts, the 'Ndrangheta has a high degree of resilience and adaptability, thanks to its horizontal structure based on family clans and its ability to infiltrate various sectors of society.</p><p>One of the questions is whether the operation will have an impact on the cocaine market in Europe and beyond. According to some reports, the 'Ndrangheta controls about 80% of Europe's cocaine supply and has connections with drug cartels in Latin America and Africa. Some analysts suggest that the operation may disrupt the 'Ndrangheta's distribution channels and create opportunities for other criminal groups to fill the gap.</p><p>Another question is whether the operation will lead to more cooperation and coordination among European countries and agencies in tackling organized crime. According to some observers, the operation showed that joint efforts are possible and effective, but also that more resources and political will are needed to sustain them.</p><h2>The most wanted</h2><p>Matteo Messina Denaro, also known as Diabolik, was Italy's most wanted mafia boss until his arrest on 16 January 2023. He was the alleged leader of the Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian mafia, and one of the most powerful and elusive criminals in the world.</p><p>Messina Denaro was born in 1962 in Castelvetrano, a town in the province of Trapani, western Sicily. He was the son of Francesco Messina Denaro, a local mafia boss who was close to the Corleonesi clan led by Totò Riina and Bernardo Provenzano.</p><p>Messina Denaro started his criminal career at a young age, committing his first murder at 18. He rose through the ranks of the Cosa Nostra, becoming involved in drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering and murder. He was convicted in absentia for several crimes, including the 1992 killings of anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and the 1993 bomb attacks in Rome, Milan and Florence.</p><p>Messina Denaro became a fugitive in 1993 and managed to evade capture for 30 years. He was considered to be the successor of Riina and Provenzano after their arrests in 1993 and 2006 respectively. He was also seen as the last "secret-keeper" of the Cosa Nostra, holding valuable information about its structure and activities.</p><p>Messina Denaro was known for his charisma, vanity and ruthlessness. He reportedly had a passion for fast cars, luxury watches and women. He once boasted that he could "fill a cemetery" with his victims. He also had a network of loyal supporters and collaborators who helped him hide and communicate with his subordinates.</p><p>Messina Denaro was captured near a private clinic in Palermo, where he was receiving treatment for cancer under a false name. He was arrested by the Carabinieri after a joint operation involving several European countries and agencies. His arrest was celebrated as a historic victory by the Italian authorities and anti-mafia activists.</p><h6>'Ndrangheta mafia, anti-mafia raids, Europe, Anti-Mafia Directorate, aftermath, operation Eureka, Matteo Messina Denaro, Cosa Nostra, arrest</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
