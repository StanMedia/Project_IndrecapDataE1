They are also known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) in the northern hemisphere and the southern lights (aurora australis) in the southern hemisphere.</p><p>Auroras are caused by activity on the sun — particularly a type of solar storm called a coronal mass ejection, which emits electrified gas and particles into space. When these electrified particles reach magnetic field lines at the north and south poles, which usually takes around three days, they enter into Earth's atmosphere. Once there, the particles and energy interact with gases in the atmosphere, producing different colored light in the sky.</p><p>Oxygen gives off green, the most commonly seen color, as well as red light. Nitrogen glows blue and purple. The colors and shapes of auroras depend on the speed, direction and density of the solar wind, as well as the altitude and composition of the atmospheric gases.</p><h2>Why are auroras more active right now?</h2><p>The sun goes through cycles of activity that last about 11 years. During periods of high activity, known as solar maximums, the sun produces more sunspots, flares and coronal mass ejections. These events can increase the intensity and frequency of auroras on Earth.</p><p>The sun is currently in an active phase of its cycle, which began in December 2019 and is expected to peak in 2025. In recent months, several powerful solar storms have occurred, sending streams of charged particles toward Earth and triggering elevated geomagnetic activity.</p><p>As a result, auroras have been more visible and vibrant than usual, appearing in some unexpected parts of the world. Photographers and night sky watchers have captured the colorful display further south (or north if you're in the southern hemisphere) than usual — places like Colorado, England and New South Wales. Pilots have circled their planes mid-flight to give their passengers a closer look at the phenomenon.</p><p>A new solar event over the weekend caused colorful auroras Sunday night and Monday morning, and more can be expected Monday night, according to EarthSky. Auroras may be visible as far south as Alabama and northern California, according to NOAA's Aurora Forecast.</p><h2>How can you see auroras?</h2><p>To see auroras, you need clear weather, dark skies and a good view of the horizon. The best time to see them is around midnight local time, when they are usually brightest and most active. You also need to be in a location that is within or near the auroral oval, which is a ring-shaped region around the poles where auroras are most likely to occur.</p><p>You can check online sources such as NOAA's Aurora Forecast or Aurora Watch to find out if there is a chance of seeing auroras in your area. You can also use apps such as Aurora Alerts or Aurora Forecast to get notifications when auroral activity is high.</p><p>If you are lucky enough to witness an aurora, you can enjoy it with your naked eye or use a camera with a tripod and a long exposure setting to capture its beauty. Remember to dress warmly, be patient and respectful of others, and avoid light pollution from artificial sources.</p><h6>Aurora borealis, Aurora australis, Solar storm, Coronal mass ejection</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
