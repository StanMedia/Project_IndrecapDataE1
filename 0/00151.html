He was found guilty of espionage, deprived of political rights for life, and had personal property worth 500,000 yuan ($71,797) confiscated.</p><p>The court did not provide any details on the allegations against Leung or the evidence used to convict him. His trial was held behind closed doors, as is common for cases involving state security in China. It is unclear where Leung was living at the time of his arrest or whether he had access to legal representation.</p><p>Leung's case was not publicly disclosed until Monday, when the court announced his sentence on its social media account. A spokesperson for the US embassy in Beijing said they were aware of the reports and that the Department of State had no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas. The State Department declined to comment further on the case citing privacy concerns.</p><h2>Leung's activities and affiliations</h2><p>According to US and Chinese media reports and records, Leung was heavily involved with Chinese cultural and expat organizations in the US. He was head of the Texas branch of the Association for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China (APPRC), which promotes Beijing's claims over Taiwan abroad.</p><p>Leung was also chair of his own foundation - the Leung Cultural Exchange Foundation - which sent musicians to and from China and the US. He frequently traveled to China to meet with government officials and participate in cultural events.</p><p>In 2017, he attended a conference in Beijing hosted by China's top political advisory body, where he met with Wang Yang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the country's most powerful decision-making body. He also met with Yu Zhengsheng, then chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who praised Leung for his contributions to promoting cross-strait relations and enhancing mutual understanding between Chinese and American people.</p><p>In 2019, he attended another conference in Beijing organized by the CPPCC, where he delivered a speech on strengthening cultural exchanges between China and the US. He also met with Wang Chen, vice chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp parliament.</p><h2>Implications for US-China relations</h2><p>Leung's sentencing comes at a time when relations between Beijing and Washington are at their lowest point in half a century amid intensifying rivalry over trade, technology, geopolitics and military supremacy. It also comes as American and Chinese officials are resuming high-level engagements since a dispute over a suspected Chinese spy balloon shattered efforts to mend ties earlier this year.</p><p>Leung is among a growing number of foreign nationals to have been ensnared in China's widening crackdown on espionage under leader Xi Jinping. In March, Chinese authorities detained a Japanese employee of Astellas Pharma in Beijing on suspected espionage – the 17th Japanese national to have been detained in China since the counter-espionage law was introduced in 2014.</p><p>In another high-profile case, two Canadians – former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor – were detained by China for nearly three years. Their arrest on espionage charges in late 2018 came shortly after Canada arrested Chinese businesswoman and Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant related to the company's business dealings in Iran. Beijing repeatedly denied that their cases were a political retaliation, but the two men were nonetheless released on the same day Meng was allowed by Canada to return to China.</p><p>Last month, China passed a wide-ranging amendment to its already sweeping counter-espionage law, which will take effect from July 1. The new legislation expanded the definition of espionage from covering state secrets and intelligence to any “documents, data, materials or items related to national security and interests,” and to include cyberattacks against state organs or critical information infrastructure.</p><p>The law also gave more powers to state security agencies to monitor, investigate and punish suspected spies, as well as those who collaborate or assist them. It also stipulated that foreign organizations and individuals who engage in activities that endanger China's national security should be held accountable according to law.</p><p>Experts have warned that the new law could pose more risks for foreign businesses, journalists, academics and NGOs operating in China, as they could face more scrutiny and pressure from Chinese authorities over their activities and interests. Experts have warned that the new law could pose more risks for foreign businesses, journalists, academics and NGOs operating in China, as they could face more scrutiny and pressure from Chinese authorities over their work and data.</p><h2>Reactions and responses</h2><p>The revised anti-espionage law has drawn concerns from foreign business groups and governments, who fear that it could be used to target or harass their members or citizens in China. The US Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said the law's impact on "investor confidence" was a concern. "We urge the Chinese government to ensure that the law is implemented in a transparent manner," it said in a statement.</p><p>The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China also expressed worries about the law's implications for its members. "The broadened scope of espionage activities and the lack of clarity on what constitutes national security and interests create uncertainty for European companies operating in China," it said. "We hope that the Chinese authorities will implement the law in a fair and consistent way."</p><p>The US State Department said it was "closely monitoring" the situation and urged China to respect human rights and the rule of law. "We have consistently expressed our concerns about China's use of vague and overly broad national security laws to arbitrarily target individuals and entities," a spokesperson said.</p><p>China has defended its anti-espionage law as a necessary measure to safeguard its national security and interests. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the law was "in line with international common practice" and "fully respects and protects the legitimate rights and interests of foreign organizations and individuals in China."</p><p>He also accused some foreign forces of "smearing" China's efforts to counter espionage and interfering in its internal affairs. "We urge them to respect China's sovereignty, stop making irresponsible remarks, and do more things that are conducive to mutual trust and cooperation," he said.</p><h6>China, US, espionage, counter-espionage law</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
