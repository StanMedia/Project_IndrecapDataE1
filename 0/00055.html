Together we will ensure there is no return to the violence of the past," he said.</p><h2>The context and the challenges</h2><p>The heightened terror threat comes amid growing tensions and instability in Northern Ireland, which has been grappling with the fallout of Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and unresolved legacy issues.</p><p>Northern Ireland, which shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union, has been at the centre of a bitter dispute over post-Brexit trade arrangements.</p><p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed by the UK and the EU as part of their divorce deal, Northern Ireland remains aligned with some EU rules to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p><p>But this has created new checks and barriers on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, angering unionists who see it as a threat to their place in the UK.</p><p>The protocol has also been blamed for disrupting trade flows and causing shortages of some products in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The UK government has unilaterally extended some grace periods on customs controls to ease the disruption, but this has triggered legal action from the EU, which accuses London of breaching international law.</p><p>The row over the protocol has inflamed sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, where a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence between mainly Catholic nationalists who want to join Ireland and mainly Protestant unionists who want to stay in the UK.</p><p>In April 2021, Northern Ireland witnessed its worst rioting in years, as loyalist youths clashed with police and nationalist communities over their frustration with the protocol and other grievances.</p><p>The violence raised fears of a return to the Troubles, which claimed more than 3,600 lives between 1968 and 1998.</p><p>The situation has also been complicated by political turmoil within Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, which brings together representatives from both communities.</p><p>In June 2021, Edwin Poots resigned as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the largest unionist party, after just three weeks in office following an internal revolt over his decision to nominate a new first minister.</p><p>Poots had replaced Arlene Foster, who was ousted by her party over her handling of Brexit and other issues.</p><p>The DUP is now led by Jeffrey Donaldson, who faces the challenge of restoring unity within his party and confidence among his supporters.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sinn Fein, the largest nationalist party and former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), has been pushing for a referendum on Irish unity as soon as possible, arguing that Brexit has changed the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without its consent.</p><p>Sinn Fein, which shares power with the DUP in the devolved government, has also been calling on the Irish government to prepare for reunification and to engage with all communities on the island of Ireland on the issue.</p><p>The heightened terror threat also comes days before a potential visit by US President Joe Biden to Northern Ireland as part of his first overseas trip since taking office.</p><p>Biden, who has Irish ancestry and has expressed support for the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, is expected to meet with political leaders and civil society groups in Belfast after attending a G7 summit in England and a NATO summit in Belgium.</p><p>Biden's visit could provide an opportunity to reaffirm the US commitment to Northern Ireland's stability and prosperity, as well as to address some of the thorny issues arising from Brexit and its impact on the region.</p><p>However, Biden's visit could also pose some challenges for the UK government, which has been accused of undermining the Good Friday Agreement and jeopardising peace in Northern Ireland by pursuing a hard Brexit.</p><p>Biden has warned that any trade deal between the US and the UK would depend on respect for the peace accord and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p><p>Biden has also expressed concern about the UK's unilateral actions on the Northern Ireland Protocol and urged both sides to work together to find a pragmatic solution.</p><h2>The outlook and the prospects</h2><p>The latest escalation of the terror threat level in Northern Ireland underscores the fragility of peace and stability in the region, as well as the complexity of its political and historical context.</p><p>It also highlights the need for dialogue and cooperation among all parties involved, including the UK and Irish governments, the Northern Ireland Executive, the EU, the US and civil society.</p><p>While there is no immediate prospect of a referendum on Irish unity, there is a growing recognition that such a possibility cannot be ruled out or ignored in the future.</p><p>There is also a growing awareness that any discussion or debate on Irish unity must be inclusive, respectful and informed by evidence and facts.</p><p>As Northern Ireland marks its centenary this year, it faces many challenges and opportunities ahead. How it navigates them will have implications not only for its own people, but also for its neighbours and allies.</p><h6>Northern Ireland, terrorism, Biden</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
