During this time, they rarely rest on the surface, but dive continuously for food and to avoid predators. How and where do they sleep in such challenging conditions?</p><p>A team of researchers from the University of California Santa Cruz and San Diego has found the answer by recording brain activity in free-ranging wild elephant seals for the first time. The study, published in the journal Science, shows that the seals sneak in short naps during deep dives while holding their breath.</p><p>The researchers fitted 13 young female seals with caps similar to those worn by humans in sleep clinics, which could measure their brain waves using electroencephalography (EEG). They also attached other instruments to track their movements and diving behavior.</p><p>The data revealed that the seals typically sleep in 10-minute bursts during 30-minute dives, often spiraling downwards while dreaming, and occasionally lying down for a nap on the seafloor. The researchers call this a "sleep spiral".</p><h2>A master switch of a brain</h2><p>When the seals enter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is associated with dreaming and memory consolidation, they experience sleep paralysis, which causes them to lose control of their posture and continue to sink. This is similar to what happens to humans when they dream, but with a crucial difference: the seals can wake up quickly and swim to the surface before drowning.</p><p>"Imagine waking from a human snore-induced sleep at the bottom of a pool and then having to swim quickly to the surface before drowning," said study coauthor Terrie Williams, director of the Integrative Carnivore EcoPhysiology Lab and comparative ecophysiologist at UC Santa Cruz. "Seals do this every day - truly an amazing master switch of a brain!"</p><p>The researchers believe that sleeping while diving allows the seals to avoid predation: they are most vulnerable to predators, such as sharks and killer whales, while at the ocean surface, so they only spend a few minutes there to breathe between dives.</p><p>"They're able to hold their breath for a long time, so they can go into a deep slumber on these dives deep below the surface where it's safe," said lead study author Jessica Kendall-Bar, postdoctoral fellow at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.</p><h2>The least sleep among mammals?</h2><p>The 10-minute naps during these dives help elephant seals get about two hours of sleep per day during foraging trips, as opposed to the 10 hours they catch while snoozing on the beach during breeding season, the researchers said.</p><p>This means that while at sea, elephant seals rival the record for the least sleep among all mammals, currently held by African elephants, which average two hours a day based on their movement patterns.</p><p>The researchers suggest that elephant seals may have evolved this ability to cope with extreme environments and physiological demands. They also hope that their study will shed light on how other marine mammals sleep at sea, and how human activities may affect their sleep quality and health.</p><h2>Implications for conservation</h2><p>The study also has implications for conservation efforts, as elephant seals face various threats from human activities such as fishing, shipping, noise pollution, and climate change. The researchers warn that disrupting the seals' sleep patterns could have negative consequences for their survival and reproduction.</p><p>"Sleep is essential for all animals," said Kendall-Bar. "If we disrupt their ability to sleep at sea or on land, we could be affecting their health and fitness."</p><p>Elephant seals are considered a conservation success story, as they were hunted to near extinction in the 19th century for their oil-rich blubber. Thanks to protection measures, their population has rebounded to about 200,000 individuals today.</p><p>However, they still face challenges from habitat loss, disease outbreaks, and human disturbance. The researchers hope that their study will help raise awareness and appreciation for these remarkable animals and their unique adaptations.</p><h6>Elephant seals, Sleep spiral, REM sleep</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
