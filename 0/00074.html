But before that, it is launching a competition to address one of the building industry's most pressing issues back on Earth: affordable housing.</p><h2>ICON uses 3D-printing technology to create houses and communities</h2><p>ICON is a 3D-printing architecture company based in Austin, Texas, that uses a high-strength concrete it calls "Lavacrete" to print walls in layers. A large machine named the "Vulcan" does the printing, fed by an on-site mixing system dubbed "Magma."</p><p>The company was founded in 2017 and has since received close to half a billion dollars in funding. It has also won a contract with NASA to develop Project Olympus, a program to design and test 3D-printed structures on the moon using lunar soil.</p><p>ICON's CEO and co-founder Jason Ballard said he has a vision for the future of architecture that is not only innovative but also inspiring.</p><p>"There are certain people who are content to build a really ugly or uninspiring world," he said. "We're not. The day I walk outside and see something ugly being built by one of my robots -- that's a nightmare scenario for me."</p><p>ICON made its name creating houses using its 3D-printing technology. Its first house was unveiled in 2018, and since then its operations have scaled up, from a collection of six homes in 2020 to a 100-home community north of Austin currently under construction (the largest printed community in the US).</p><p>At each stage, the size of the properties has increased, from 350 square feet to over 2,000 square feet, as the technology has advanced and 3D-printed homes have moved from prototype to novelty to relatively mainstream.</p><p>A thread running through ICON's work is building homes for disadvantaged people, including accommodation for the long-term homeless, often in collaboration with non-profits. Creating affordable housing is also an objective, which led the company to launch design competition Initiative 99 last month.</p><h2>Initiative 99 seeks designs for 3D-printed homes under $99,000</h2><p>Initiative 99 is a design competition that invites architects and designers from around the world to submit proposals for homes that can be 3D-printed for $99,000 or less.</p><p>Ballard described it as "a call to arms for the global architecture and design community" to get to grips with "one of the most pressing industries in need of a rethink."</p><p>According to the Pew Research Center, about half of Americans reported affordable housing was a "major problem" in their area in 2021. One estimate from late 2020 calculated the US had a housing supply deficit of 3.8 million units.</p><p>Peggy Bailey is vice president of housing and income security at progressive US think tank the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Bailey explained that in the US, many people struggle to pay for their accommodation.</p><p>"The cost of housing has outpaced wages for decades," she said. "People are spending more than half of their income on rent or their mortgage."</p><p>Bailey said that affordable housing is not only a matter of economic security but also of health and well-being.</p><p>"Housing is foundational," she said. "If you don't have stable housing, it's hard to do anything else. It's hard to keep a job, it's hard to keep your kids in school, it's hard to stay healthy."</p><p>Bailey said that while 3D-printing technology could be part of the solution for affordable housing, it is not enough by itself.</p><p>"We need more investment in affordable housing at all levels of government," she said. "We need more subsidies for low-income renters, more tax credits for developers who build affordable units, more land use policies that encourage density and diversity."</p><p>Bailey also said that affordable housing should not compromise on quality or design.</p><p>"We need housing that is not only affordable but also accessible, sustainable and beautiful," she said. "We need housing that respects people's dignity and enhances their lives."</p><h2>ICON hopes to inspire innovation and creativity in architecture</h2><p>Ballard said he hopes that Initiative 99 will inspire innovation and creativity in architecture and challenge the status quo of the building industry.</p><p>He said he believes that 3D-printing technology can offer many advantages over traditional construction methods, such as speed, efficiency, precision and customization.</p><p>He also said that 3D-printing technology can enable more creative and diverse designs that reflect the needs and preferences of the people who live in them.</p><p>"We want to empower architects and designers to create more beautiful and inspiring spaces," he said. "We want to give them more freedom and flexibility to experiment and innovate."</p><p>Ballard said he also hopes that 3D-printing technology will democratize architecture and make it more accessible and affordable for more people.</p><p>"We want to make architecture more inclusive and diverse," he said. "We want to make it more responsive and adaptable to different contexts and cultures."</p><p>Ballard said he is optimistic about the future of 3D-printing technology and its potential to transform the built environment on Earth and beyond.</p><p>He said he is looking forward to seeing the submissions for Initiative 99 and selecting the winners, who will receive cash prizes and the opportunity to collaborate with ICON on future projects.</p><p>He said he is also excited about Project Olympus and the prospect of building on the moon.</p><p>"We're not just building houses, we're building a new way of building," he said. "We're building a new way of living."</p><h6>ICON, 3D-printing, architecture, affordable housing, moon</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
