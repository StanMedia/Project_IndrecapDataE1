He founded Gusa Publishing, which published books that often cast a critical eye on China's ruling Communist Party or touched on China's political taboos, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre.</p><h2>What happened to him?</h2><p>Li returned to China in March 2021 to visit his relatives and deal with residency-related issues, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. He reportedly disappeared shortly after arriving in Shanghai. Weeks later, a spokesperson of China's Taiwan Affairs Office confirmed that Li was being investigated by state security authorities for his "suspected engagement in activities that endangered state security."</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>Li's detention comes at a tense moment in cross-strait relations, as China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to "unify" the island with mainland China. Many in Taiwan reject Beijing's claim and have been repelled by the authoritarian rule of China's leader Xi Jinping, who has stepped up efforts to crack down on dissent both within and outside its borders.</p><p>Li's case also echoes the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015, who were secretly detained by Chinese authorities over their involvement with a publisher of books offering scathing descriptions of Xi and other Communist Party leaders. One of them, Gui Minhai, is serving a 10-year prison sentence on charges of providing intelligence abroad.</p><h2>How did Taiwan react?</h2><p>Taiwan's Minister of Mainland Affairs Council Chiu Tai-san said Wednesday that the arrest of Li and another pro-independence activist from Taiwan, Yang Chih-yuan, who was formally arrested on suspicion of "secession" in China on Tuesday, showed that "China is exercising its long-arm jurisdiction to Taiwan not only to threaten but also to suppress Taiwan."</p><p>Chiu urged Taiwanese citizens to evaluate the risks before traveling to mainland China and called on Beijing to respect human rights and the rule of law.</p><h2>How China uses national security law to suppress dissent</h2><p>According to China’s National Security Law, which was enacted in 2015, "endangering state security" is a broad term that covers a range of offenses, such as espionage, terrorism, separatism, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces. The law also stipulates that China has jurisdiction over national security cases involving foreign organizations and individuals outside its territory.</p><p>China has used the national security law to crack down on dissent both within and outside its borders. In recent years, several Taiwan citizens have been detained in China on state security grounds, such as Lee Ming-che, a human rights activist who was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion in 2017, and Cheng Yu-chin, a businessman who was arrested for espionage in 2019. China has also imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, which has led to the arrest of dozens of pro-democracy activists and politicians for alleged subversion, secession, or collusion with foreign forces.</p><p>China’s national security law has raised concerns among human rights groups and foreign governments, who have accused Beijing of violating international norms and undermining the rule of law. Critics say the law is vague and sweeping, and can be used to silence dissenting voices and suppress political opposition. The law also poses a threat to Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy, as China claims the island as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to "unify" it with mainland China.</p><h6>China, Taiwan, Publisher, Detention, national security law, uspected engagement in activities that endangered state security</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
