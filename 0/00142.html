The elusive and controversial question that biologists still debate</h1><p><img src=https://a1.indrecap.com/0/00142.webp height=281 class=antiCLS /></p><p class=imgCredit>Litoria mira, AKA the Chocolate Frog/Steve Richards</p><p>Scientists have different ways of defining and identifying species, but none of them applies to all life forms on Earth.</p><h2>The challenge of classifying biodiversity</h2><p>Earth is home to a staggering diversity of life forms, from microscopic bacteria to towering sequoias, from colorful fish to hairy sloths. Scientists estimate that there are between 8 and 8.7 million species on the planet, but most of them are not described or named. To make sense of this biological richness, biologists use a system of classification that groups organisms based on their shared ancestry and characteristics. The smallest and most basic unit of this system is the species.</p><p>A species is often defined as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. For example, humans are one species, Homo sapiens, because they can mate with each other and have children that can also reproduce. This definition is based on the concept of gene flow, which means that individuals of the same species share a common pool of genes that can be exchanged through reproduction.</p><p>However, this definition is not always easy to apply in nature. There are many cases where organisms that look very different can interbreed, such as polar bears and grizzly bears, or where organisms that look very similar cannot interbreed, such as eastern and western meadowlarks. There are also many organisms that reproduce asexually, such as bacteria and some plants and animals, which do not need a partner to produce offspring. How can biologists determine if these organisms belong to the same species or not?</p><h2>The alternative approaches to defining species</h2><p>To address these challenges, biologists have proposed different ways of defining species based on other criteria, such as morphology, ecology, behavior or genetics. These are some of the most common approaches:</p><ul><li><p>Morphological species concept: This approach defines species based on their physical appearance and structure. It is useful for identifying fossils and organisms that are difficult to observe in their natural habitats, such as deep-sea creatures. However, it can be subjective and misleading, as some organisms may look alike due to convergent evolution (when unrelated organisms evolve similar features) or may look different due to phenotypic plasticity (when the same organism can change its appearance depending on environmental conditions).</p></li><li><p>Ecological species concept: This approach defines species based on their role and interactions in their ecosystems. It considers factors such as habitat preferences, food sources, predators and competitors. It is useful for understanding how organisms adapt to their environments and how they affect each other. However, it can be difficult to measure and compare these factors across different locations and times.</p></li><li><p>Behavioral species concept: This approach defines species based on their mating behaviors and preferences. It considers factors such as courtship rituals, vocalizations, pheromones and mate recognition. It is useful for understanding how organisms communicate and attract each other and how they avoid mating with the wrong partners. However, it can be influenced by learning and culture and may not reflect genetic differences.</p></li><li><p>Genetic species concept: This approach defines species based on their DNA sequences and molecular markers. It considers factors such as genetic similarity, divergence and hybridization. It is useful for revealing the evolutionary history and relationships of organisms and for detecting cryptic species (species that are genetically distinct but morphologically indistinguishable). However, it can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain and analyze genetic data and it may not account for phenotypic variation.</p></li></ul><h2>The implications of defining species</h2><p>The definition of a species is not just a theoretical question for biologists. It has practical implications for many aspects of human society and well-being. For example:</p><ul><li><p>Agriculture: The definition of a species affects how farmers cultivate crops and livestock and how they deal with pests and diseases. For instance, some crops may be more productive or resistant if they are hybridized with closely related species or varieties, while some pests may be more harmful or invasive if they can interbreed with native or introduced species.</p></li><li><p>Medicine: The definition of a species affects how doctors diagnose and treat infections and diseases caused by different pathogens. For example, some bacteria may belong to the same species but have different strains that vary in their virulence or resistance to antibiotics, while some viruses may belong to different species but have similar symptoms or transmission modes.</p></li><li><p>Conservation: The definition of a species affects how conservationists protect endangered animals, plants and habitats. For example, some animals may belong to the same species but have different subspecies or populations that vary in their genetic diversity or adaptation to local conditions. These variations may be important for the survival and resilience of the species in the face of environmental changes, such as climate change or habitat loss. Therefore, conservationists may need to consider not only the number of individuals of a species, but also the distribution and diversity of its genetic units.</p></li></ul><p>There are different methods and strategies for conserving species, depending on their status, threats and needs. One of the most common methods is in-situ conservation, which means protecting species in their natural habitat or ecosystem. This involves preserving and restoring the quality and integrity of the environment where the species live, as well as reducing or eliminating the factors that endanger them, such as overexploitation, poaching, pollution or invasive species. In-situ conservation can benefit not only the target species, but also the other organisms that share its habitat and the ecosystem functions that sustain them.</p><p>Another method is ex-situ conservation, which means protecting species outside their natural habitat or ecosystem. This involves maintaining and breeding species in artificial settings, such as zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens or seed banks. Ex-situ conservation can be useful for species that are critically endangered or extinct in the wild, as it can provide a safe and controlled environment for their survival and reproduction. It can also serve as a source of individuals for reintroduction or reinforcement programs, which aim to restore wild populations of a species.</p><p>Both in-situ and ex-situ conservation methods have advantages and disadvantages, and they are often complementary rather than mutually exclusive. The choice of the most appropriate method depends on the specific circumstances and objectives of each conservation project. Ideally, conservation efforts should be based on sound scientific knowledge and evidence, as well as on ethical and social considerations.</p><h2>The future of defining species</h2><p>The definition of a species is not a fixed or universal concept, but rather a dynamic and context-dependent one. It reflects not only the biological reality of nature, but also the human understanding and interpretation of it. As new discoveries and technologies emerge, biologists may revise or refine their definitions and methods of identifying species. For example, advances in molecular biology and genomics have enabled biologists to compare DNA sequences of organisms more easily and accurately than ever before, revealing new insights into their evolutionary relationships and diversity.</p><p>However, no single definition or method can capture all the complexity and variability of life on Earth. Therefore, biologists may need to adopt a pluralistic and pragmatic approach to defining species, using different criteria and perspectives depending on the purpose and scope of their study. Moreover, biologists may need to collaborate and communicate with other stakeholders involved in conservation, such as policy makers, managers, educators and the public, to ensure that their definitions and classifications are relevant and useful for addressing the challenges and opportunities of conserving biodiversity.</p><h2>New Species Information Supplement</h2><p>Here is some information about the chocolate frog, the rainbow fish and the Saurona triangula:</p><ul><li><p>The chocolate frog (Ranoidea mira) is a species of tree frog that was discovered in New Guinea by a research team led by Griffith University. It has a chocolate-brown skin and a tapir-like snout. It belongs to the same species complex as the Australian green tree frog (Ranoidea caerulea), which suggests a common ancestor when Australia and New Guinea were connected by land. It was named mira (meaning surprised or strange in Latin) because of its unexpected discovery and appearance12</p></li><li><p>The rainbow fish (Plectranthias winniensis) is a species of perch that was discovered in the Indian Ocean near the island of Mauritius. It lives in the mesophotic zone, a deep-water habitat with low light levels. It has a striking coloration of red, orange, yellow, green and blue, which may help it communicate or camouflage in its environment. It was named winniensis after Winnifred Noyes, a supporter of the California Academy of Sciences, which led the expedition that found the fish3</p></li><li><p>The Saurona triangula is a species of lizard that was discovered in Madagascar by a research team from the University of Antananarivo and the Zoological State Collection Munich. It belongs to the family Scincidae, which includes skinks and other lizards with smooth scales and reduced limbs. It has a triangular head with large eyes and nostrils, which may help it detect prey or predators in its leaf litter habitat. It was named triangula after its distinctive head shape.</p></li></ul><h6>Species definition; Biodiversity; Extinction; Conservation; In-situ; Ex-situ</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
