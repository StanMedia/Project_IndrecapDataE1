The company announced the news on Tuesday, saying it will continue to work with Broadcom to develop 5G radio frequency components and other wireless connectivity parts.</p><p>The 5G components include FBAR filters, which are used to filter out unwanted signals and noise in wireless devices. The FBAR filters will be designed and built in several American manufacturing and technology hubs, including Fort Collins, Colorado, where Broadcom operates a facility.</p><p>“We’re thrilled to make commitments that harness the ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit of American manufacturing,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “All of Apple’s products depend on technology engineered and built here in the United States, and we’ll continue to deepen our investments in the US economy because we have an unshakable belief in America’s future.”</p><h2>Why is this deal important?</h2><p>The deal is part of a larger commitment Apple made in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the US economy over five years. Apple said it is on track to meet its goal, following direct spending with American suppliers, data center investments and capital expenditures.</p><p>Apple also said that it supports more than 2.7 million jobs in the US through direct employment, developer jobs in the iOS app economy, and spending with more than 9,000 US suppliers and manufacturers of all sizes in all 50 states across dozens of sectors.</p><p>The deal also reflects Apple’s efforts to boost its 5G capabilities and innovation. Apple introduced 5G technology to its devices in 2020, and has helped expand and expedite 5G adoption across the country, driving innovation and job growth among companies that support 5G innovation and infrastructure.</p><p>5G technology is shaping the future of next-generation consumer electronics, and Apple is spending tens of billions of dollars to develop this field in the US. 5G coverage and performance also continue to expand around the world, and more users are benefitting from faster connectivity as they upgrade to 5G-capable products.</p><h2>What are the benefits of 5G technology?</h2><p>5G technology is the fifth generation of wireless communication standards that offer faster speeds, lower latency, higher capacity, and more reliability than previous generations. 5G technology can enable new applications and experiences that were not possible before, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, cloud gaming, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, telemedicine, and more.</p><p>According to a report by Qualcomm, 5G technology could generate up to $13.2 trillion of global economic output by 2035, and support up to 22.3 million jobs worldwide. The report also estimated that 5G technology could enhance global GDP growth by $2 trillion over the next 15 years.</p><h6>Apple, Broadcom, 5G technology, US economy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
