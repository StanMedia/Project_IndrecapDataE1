Pineapple on pizza? Non si fa. Spaghetti bolognese? Che orrore. But now, some Italians seem to be wising up to the fact that other countries can make good Italian food, too.</p><p>Enter 50 Top Pizza, an international guide run by Italians that produces a series of annual rankings rewarding some of the best pizzerias on the planet. The 2023 European list has just been published – and, according to 1,000 anonymous "inspectors" across the continent, the best pizza in Europe is in… Spain.</p><p>Sartoria Panatieri, in Barcelona, was judged the best on the continent. The award was announced at a ceremony, which was also held in Barcelona. Second place went to Copenhagen restaurant Bæst, while coming in third was 50 Kalò in London, a spin-off of the original 50 Kalò pizzeria in Naples.</p><p>There’s a catch of course. Italy was not in competition. The entity – a pizza guide, which has been ranking restaurants since 2017 – has separate listings for the 50 best pizzerias in the cradle of pizza.</p><p>Sartoria Panatieri is run by Rafa Panatieri and Jorge Sastre. Panatieri grew up in Brazil, but with Italian origins, from Pisa and Calabria. Initially training as a veterinarian, he changed tack to become a chef in South America and Italy, before moving to Spain. He worked in Michelin-starred restaurant Nectari in Barcelona before opening his pizzeria.</p><p>In a statement, Panatieri said: "We are very proud to have been named the best pizzeria in Europe. This award is a recognition to the dedication that we put every day in Sartoria Panatieri since we opened five years ago with the intention of fulfilling a dream that today we have been able to fulfill thanks to the work of the entire team."</p><p>Panatieri also took home the award for Pizza of the Year 2023 with his "Salsa de tomates cherry asados, mozzarella y holandesa de albahaca" wood-fired pizza: tomato sauce, mozzarella, roasted cherry tomatoes and basil hollandaise. The pizza costs €12.90 ($14.20). Pie prices at the restaurant start from $12.</p><p>The best pizza was judged to be Panatieri's "Salsa de tomates cherry asados, mozzarella y holandesa de albahaca."

They’re created by around 1,000 "inspectors" around the world, who first vote for the best places in their own countries, and then make anonymous visits.</p><p>"For each pizzeria we have several reports of anonymous visits that help us complete the work of ranking," Barbara Guerra, one of three curators, told CNN.</p><p>The criteria for judging a pizza include the quality of ingredients, dough leavening and cooking methods, service and atmosphere. The guide also considers sustainability and social responsibility aspects such as waste management and fair wages.</p><p>The guide aims to promote pizza as a gastronomic product that reflects local culture and traditions. It also seeks to encourage innovation and creativity among pizza makers.</p><p>According to Guerra, Sartoria Panatieri stood out for its "excellent doughs made with different types of flour", its "careful selection of ingredients" and its "original combinations that enhance the flavors".</p><p>She also praised its "elegant and refined" setting and its "professional and attentive" service.</p><h2>How does Spain compare to other countries?</h2><p>Spain may not be known for its pizza culture, but it has been making strides in recent years. According to 50 Top Pizza, there are now more than 300 pizzerias in Barcelona alone.</p><p>The guide ranked Spain as the fourth-best country for pizza in Europe after France (with 11 pizzerias on the list), Germany (10) and UK (9). Denmark came fifth with eight pizzerias.</p><p>Other notable entries on the list include Lilla Napoli in Falkenberg, Sweden, which was awarded the "best pizza in Scandinavia" prize, and Pizzarium in Rome, which won the "best pizza al taglio" (by the slice) award.</p><p>Meanwhile, 50 Kalò, which had been awarded first place in previous rankings, has slid down the list in recent years. However, it did take home the award for the "best fried pasta pie" this year.</p><p>The guide also has separate rankings for the best pizzerias in North America, South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The 2023 global list will be announced in October.</p><h6>pizza, Spain, Italy, 50 Top Pizza, Sartoria Panatieri</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
