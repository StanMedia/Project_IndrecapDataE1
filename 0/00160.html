The feature will require users to pay extra for adding "extra members" to their account who can use the service outside their household.</p><p>The feature was announced in an email sent to some US subscribers on Tuesday, as part of a long-planned move to reduce password sharing and increase revenue.</p><p>"Your Netflix account is for you and the people you live with — your household," the email reads, along with options on how to share the account.</p><p>To share an account with someone outside a household, a user can transfer a profile to a new membership that they pay for or else add an extra member to their account for an additional $7.99 monthly fee.</p><p>Netflix subscribers on its two cheapest plans (Basic or Standard with Ads, which cost $9.99 and $6.99 per month, respectively) don't have the option to add extra members to their account at all.</p><p>Netflix subscribers who have the Netflix Standard plan that costs $15.49 per month can add one extra member who can use the service outside their household for $7.99 extra each month.</p><p>Netflix subscribers who have the Netflix Premium package with 4K streaming that costs $19.99 per month can add up to two extra members, but each one will still cost another $7.99.</p><p>Extra members will have their own password and profile, paid for by the person who "invited" them to join. They will also have some restrictions, such as being able to view or download content on only one device at a time and not being able to create extra profiles or log in as a Kids profile.</p><p>Netflix defines a household as a location where users watch Netflix on a TV and what IP address that device uses. Users can reset their household location using the app on a TV or a device connected to a TV by choosing to confirm or update their household and responding to a verification link sent to the account's listed email address or phone number.</p><h2>Why is Netflix doing this and what are the reactions?</h2><p>Netflix has been turning a blind eye to password sharing for a long time, as it was fueling its growth and popularity. However, the company has also been losing millions of dollars in potential revenue from password sharing, as it estimates that more than 100 million households worldwide share an account.</p><p>The company has also been facing increasing competition from other streaming services, such as Disney+, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, which have been attracting customers with exclusive content and lower prices.</p><p>Therefore, Netflix has decided to crack down on password sharing in order to boost its income and retain its subscribers. The company said it was testing the new feature "to ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so."</p><p>The feature has received mixed reactions from Netflix users and observers. Some users have expressed their frustration and anger over the new feature, saying it was unfair and greedy. Some users have also threatened to cancel their subscription or switch to other streaming services.</p><p>Other users have supported the new feature, saying it was reasonable and justified. Some users have also said they were willing to pay extra for sharing their account with their friends or family members.</p><p>Some observers have said the new feature could backfire on Netflix, as it could alienate its loyal customers and drive them away. Some observers have also said the new feature could be easily bypassed by using VPNs or other methods.</p><p>Other observers have said the new feature could benefit Netflix, as it could generate more revenue and reduce piracy. Some observers have also said the new feature could be seen as a sign of confidence and strength by Netflix, as it shows it is not afraid of losing customers or competitors.</p><h6>Netflix, password sharing, crackdown, US, streaming</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
