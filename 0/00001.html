The documents, which were posted on social media by an alleged hacker, suggest that the US intelligence agencies intercepted and recorded private conversations between Guterres and Mohammed on various issues, such as the conflict in Ukraine, the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia and the climate change negotiations.</p><p>According to CNN, which obtained some of the documents, the leak also accuses Guterres of being too soft on Russia and undermining broader efforts to hold Moscow accountable for its actions in Ukraine. The leak appears to shed light on how Washington perceived Guterres' handling of the Black Sea grain deal, which allowed Russia to export wheat to Egypt despite US sanctions. The documents allege that Guterres emphasized his efforts to improve Russia's ability to export, even if that involves sanctioned Russian entities or individuals.</p><p>The UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Tuesday that "the UN has made it clear that such actions are inconsistent with the obligations of the United States of America enumerated in the UN charter and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations". He added that the UN also sent a note to the US Mission at the United Nations in New York regarding the leak.</p><p>Dujarric said that Guterres was not surprised by the fact that people were spying on him and listening in on his private conversations, but he was surprised by the "malfeasance or incompetence" that allowed for such private conversations to be distorted and become public. He also defended Guterres' record, saying that "the Secretary-General is not soft on any one country".</p><h2>US faces backlash and legal implications for its espionage activities</h2><p>The US spying on the UN is not a new phenomenon, as previous leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the US had tapped the phones of former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other world leaders. However, this latest leak comes at a time when the US is trying to restore its credibility and leadership on the global stage under President Joe Biden, who has pledged to reengage with allies and multilateral institutions.</p><p>The leak could damage the trust and cooperation between the US and the UN, as well as other countries that may feel violated by the US surveillance. It could also expose the US to legal consequences, as spying on UN officials may violate international law and human rights norms. According to Article 2(4) of the UN charter, "all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state". Moreover, Article 105(2) of the UN charter states that "the privileges and immunities of diplomatic agents ... shall also be accorded to representatives of members while exercising their functions".</p><p>The US may also face domestic legal challenges, as some of its spying activities may have been conducted under authorities granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is due to expire this year without a clear path to renewal. FISA allows the US government to obtain warrants from a secret court to conduct electronic surveillance on foreign targets for national security purposes. However, FISA has been criticized by civil liberties groups and lawmakers for violating privacy rights and enabling mass surveillance without adequate oversight.</p><p>The Department of Defense and the intelligence community are reportedly reviewing and assessing the validity of the leaked documents that are circulating on social media sites, but they have not confirmed or commented on any specific information they contain. A State Department spokesperson said last week that "the United States takes seriously its obligations under international law".</p><h6>UN, US, spying, leak, diplomacy</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
