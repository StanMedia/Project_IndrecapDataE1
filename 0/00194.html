It analyzes data from 75 countries, covering over 80 per cent of the world's population, and measures how social beliefs affect gender equality in areas such as politics, work, education and health.</p><p>The report finds that while some progress has been made in closing the gender gap in education and health, women and girls still face significant barriers in accessing economic opportunities, political representation and decision-making power. According to the report, about half of the world's men and women feel that men make better political leaders, and more than 40 per cent feel that men make better business executives. Furthermore, almost 30 per cent of people agree that it is acceptable for a man to beat his wife.</p><p>The report also reveals that violence against women and girls is a global pandemic, affecting one in three women in their lifetime. The report cites data from 41 countries, showing that women are more likely to experience intimate partner violence if they have less education, earn less than their partners, or live in countries with higher levels of gender inequality.</p><h2>Social norms need to change to achieve gender equality</h2><p>The report argues that social norms - the unwritten rules that govern how people should behave - are one of the main drivers of gender inequality. Social norms shape people's attitudes, behaviors and expectations, often reinforcing stereotypes and discrimination against women and girls. The report calls for challenging and transforming these norms, through policies, laws, media, education and community engagement.</p><p>The report also highlights some positive examples of social norm change, such as the global decline in child marriage, the increase in women's political participation in some regions, and the growing support for gender equality among young people. The report urges governments, civil society, private sector and individuals to take action to accelerate social norm change and advance gender equality.</p><p>The report is part of UNDP's Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI), which was launched in 2019 as a tool to measure the invisible barriers that women face in achieving their full potential. The GSNI is based on data from the World Values Survey and covers four dimensions: political empowerment, educational empowerment, economic empowerment and physical integrity.</p><p>The report comes ahead of the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), the UN's largest gathering on gender equality and women's rights, which will take place from March 9 to 20 in New York. The CSW will review the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a landmark document adopted 25 years ago at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.</p><h6>UN report, gender bias, social norms, violence against women</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
