According to Spain's national weather agency AEMET, April was the hottest and driest month recorded on the Spanish mainland since record-keeping began back in 1961. The agency said that the Spanish mainland received just 22 percent of the normal amount of rainfall in April.</p><p>The drought has also exacerbated the environmental and social impacts of illegal water use, especially in the southern Andalusia region, where water restrictions are in place to conserve the scarce resource. Andalusia is home to many subtropical fruit plantations, such as avocados and mangos, that require large amounts of water to grow. Some farmers have resorted to tapping groundwater from illegal wells to irrigate their crops, without regard for the consequences.</p><h2>Spanish police arrest dozens of illegal well users</h2><p>In recent months, Spanish police have arrested 26 people and are investigating 44 more for their alleged involvement in a scheme to use water from illegal wells to grow subtropical fruit in the Axarquia district east of Malaga, along the Mediterranean coast. The police said that a four-year investigation had uncovered 250 illegal wells and ponds in the area, which is estimated to have caused nearly $11 million in damages.</p><p>The suspects include growers, business executives, workers at community irrigation projects, and those who sell and install irrigation pipes and equipment. They are accused of crimes against natural resources and the environment and fraudulent use of water. The police said that prosecutors in Malaga specialized in environmental offenses were involved, along with an investigating magistrate at a court in the city of Velez Malaga. The 26 people arrested have been arraigned before the magistrate and released, with charges pending.</p><h2>Illegal water use threatens ecology and economy</h2><p>The illegal use of water from underground wells not only violates the law, but also poses serious threats to the ecology and economy of Spain. According to environmentalists, the overexploitation of groundwater lowers the water table, reduces the flow of rivers and springs, affects wetlands and wildlife habitats, and increases the risk of saltwater intrusion and soil erosion. Moreover, the illegal wells often lack proper sanitation and filtration systems, which can contaminate the water quality and endanger public health.</p><p>The illegal use of water also harms the legitimate farmers who abide by the water restrictions and pay for their water consumption. They face unfair competition from those who use water for free and without limits, and they suffer from reduced water availability and higher costs. Furthermore, the illegal use of water undermines the efforts of the regional and national authorities to manage the water resources sustainably and efficiently, especially in times of drought.</p><h2>Spain needs more action and awareness to tackle water crisis</h2><p>The crackdown on illegal well users is a positive step towards addressing the water crisis in Spain, but more action and awareness are needed to ensure long-term solutions. The authorities need to enforce stricter regulations and penalties for illegal water use, monitor and control groundwater extraction, promote alternative sources of water such as desalination and reuse, and invest in infrastructure and technology to improve water efficiency and conservation.</p><p>The farmers need to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices, such as choosing less water-intensive crops, using drip irrigation systems, applying organic fertilizers, and implementing crop rotation and diversification. The consumers need to be more conscious of their water footprint, reduce their demand for water-intensive products, support local and organic farmers, and adopt water-saving habits at home.</p><p>The media need to play a role in raising awareness and educating the public about the causes and consequences of the water crisis, as well as the actions and solutions that can be taken by different stakeholders. The media can also showcase best practices and success stories of individuals, communities, businesses, and organizations that are making a difference in saving water and protecting the environment.</p><h2>The aftermath of 250 illegal wells and ponds in the drought-hit Axarquia district</h2><p>The discovery of 250 illegal wells and ponds in the Axarquia district east of Malaga has exposed the extent of the water crisis in the region and its impact on the environment and agriculture. The Axarquia district is part of the comarca of La Axarquía, a wedge-shaped area that extends along the coast and inland, and is known for its subtropical fruit plantations, such as avocados and mangos. The comarca is also home to 31 beautiful Mudejar villages, each with its own charm and traditions.</p><p>However, the Axarquia district has been suffering from a prolonged and exceptional drought since June 2021, which has reduced the water availability and increased the water demand for irrigation. Some farmers have resorted to using water from illegal wells and ponds to water their crops, without regard for the law or the consequences. According to Spanish police, a four-year investigation had uncovered 250 illegal wells and ponds in the area, which are estimated to have caused nearly $11 million in damages. The police have arrested 26 people and are investigating 44 more for their alleged involvement in the scheme.</p><p>The illegal use of water from underground wells and ponds not only violates the law, but also poses serious threats to the ecology and economy of the region.
