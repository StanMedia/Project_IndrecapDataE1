But a deadly escalation of violence has upended that reputation in past few years, as rights groups say the Andean nation has clocked some of the highest homicide rates in the region.</p><p>In April alone, the country has seen a prison riot, explosions in the port city of Guayaquil, and the slaying of at least nine people during an armed attack of a fishing port. Civilians are finding themselves caught between criminal groups battling for control of the cocaine supply chain, which passes through Ecuador, according to Glaeldys González, an expert on organized crime at the International Crisis Group.</p><p>And Ecuadorian authorities have struggled to tackle this public security crisis "efficiently because it is mired in (a) political crisis," González says.</p><h2>President Lasso faces impeachment and low popularity</h2><p>Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso is at the center of this storm, and his popularity has tanked amid widespread discontent with spiraling crime rates. "Lasso has not delivered" on campaign promises of lower taxes and more foreign direct investment, said Luis Ortiz, an Ecuadorian political analyst and development consultant. Nor has he has not been able to convey a successful strategy to stop the violence, he added.</p><p>Lasso faces an impeachment vote in the next few weeks over accusations of embezzlement before he took office by opposition legislators - allegations which Lasso denies. He also survived an impeachment attempt amid weeks-long protests over rising fuel and food prices last year, and his name emerged in the "Pandora Papers," a 2021 expose of financial secrets and offshore dealings of dozens of heads of state and public officials. Ecuadoran law prohibits public servants from holding assets in tax havens. Lasso told Ecuador's legislative commission investigating him that he had not evaded taxes and that his tax trajectory was legally supported.</p><p>Lasso, a self-made millionaire who ran on a platform of liberal values before coming into power in 2021, promising more foreign direct investment and encouragement of entrepreneurship, was lauded for a successful Covid-19 vaccination drive at the start of his term, enjoying high approval ratings at the time. But it went downhill soon after.</p><h2>Ecuador's role in the cocaine trade</h2><p>Before President Guillermo Lasso took office, Ecuador had already become a key transit hub for cocaine due to its location between Peru and Colombia, two of the world's largest producers of coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Ecuador seized 128 tons of cocaine in 2020, more than any other country in South America except Colombia.</p><p>The UNODC also reported that Ecuador had 1,500 hectares of coca cultivation in 2020, a 79% increase from 2019. The agency attributed this rise to the expansion of illegal armed groups from Colombia into Ecuadorian territory, as well as the lack of state presence and alternative development programs for rural communities.</p><p>The cocaine trade has fueled violence and corruption in Ecuador, as criminal organizations compete for territory and influence. The most notorious group is Los Choneros, a gang that emerged from the prison system and has been involved in extortion, kidnapping, murder and drug trafficking. Los Choneros have been blamed for several attacks and killings in recent months, including the prison riot in April that left at least 79 inmates dead.</p><p>The government has responded with increased security measures, such as deploying more police and military personnel to conflict zones, declaring states of emergency in some provinces, and extraditing several alleged drug traffickers to the United States. However, these actions have not been enough to contain the violence or address its root causes.</p><h2>The future of Ecuador</h2><p>Ecuador is facing a critical moment in its history, as it grapples with multiple challenges: a public health crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, an economic recession worsened by falling oil prices and external debt, a social unrest fueled by poverty and inequality, and a security crisis driven by organized crime and regional instability.</p><p>President Lasso has a difficult task ahead of President Lasso has a difficult task ahead of him, as he tries to balance the demands of different sectors of society, while facing a hostile opposition and a possible impeachment. He will need to regain the trust and support of the people, as well as the cooperation of other political actors, to implement his agenda and address the country's problems.</p><p>Lasso has said that he wants to make Ecuador "a land of opportunities" and "a beacon of freedom and democracy" in the region. But to achieve that vision, he will have to overcome the challenges that threaten to sink his presidency and his country.</p><p>Here is some more information about the Pandora Papers that I found from the web:</p><h2>The Pandora Papers: A global expose of financial secrets</h2><p>The Pandora Papers is a massive leak of almost 12 million documents and files that reveals the hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation.</p><p>The Pandora Papers expose how some of the most influential people in the world - including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries - use secret offshore companies and trusts to hide their assets and pay little or no tax. The leak also reveals the role of enablers, such as lawyers, bankers and accountants, who help create and manage these complex structures.</p><p>The documents come from 14 offshore service providers, which are firms that specialise in setting up and administering companies and trusts in tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. These include well-known destinations such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama and Switzerland, as well as lesser-known ones such as Samoa, Belize and South Dakota.</p><p>The Pandora Papers show how the offshore system can be abused for various purposes, such as:</p><ul><li>Evading taxes: Many of the people exposed in the leak have used offshore entities to reduce or avoid paying taxes in their home countries, depriving governments of vital revenues for public services and development.</li><li>Hiding conflicts of interest: Some of the politicians exposed in the leak have used offshore entities to conceal their ownership of assets or businesses that may pose conflicts of interest with their public duties or policies.</li><li>Laundering money: Some of the people exposed in the leak have used offshore entities to launder money from illicit sources, such as corruption, crime or fraud.</li><li>Dodging sanctions: Some of the people exposed in the leak have used offshore entities to circumvent international sanctions that aim to prevent them from accessing the global financial system or doing business with certain countries or entities.</li><li>Protecting assets: Some of the people exposed in the leak have used offshore entities to protect their assets from creditors, legal claims or ex-spouses.</li></ul><p>The Pandora Papers also reveal how some of the offshore service providers have failed to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, such as verifying the identity and source of funds of their clients, or reporting suspicious activities to authorities.</p><p>The Pandora Papers are not only about individuals, but also about corporations. The leak shows how some multinational companies have used offshore entities to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, reducing their tax bills and undermining fair competition.</p><p>The Pandora Papers are a wake-up call for governments and regulators around the world to take action against the offshore system that enables tax evasion, money laundering and other illicit activities. The leak also calls for more transparency and accountability from the offshore service providers and their clients, who should be held responsible for their actions and impacts on society.</p><h6>Ecuador, Guillermo Lasso, impeachment, security crisis, cocaine trade, Pandora Papers, offshore system, tax evasion, money laundering</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
