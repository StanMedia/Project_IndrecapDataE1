The targets included maritime and transportation companies, defense contractors, think tanks, universities, and local governments.</p><p>Microsoft said the hackers were likely trying to develop capabilities that could disrupt "critical communications infrastructure" between the US and Asia in the event of a crisis. The company also said it had notified the affected customers and provided them with tools to remove the malware and secure their systems.</p><h2>US officials concerned about the "scope and scale" of Chinese hacking activity</h2><p>US officials told CNN that they believed Chinese hackers could still have access to sensitive US computer networks they had targeted in recent months, and that they were concerned about the "scope and scale" of the activity.</p><p>The National Security Agency Director of Cybersecurity Rob Joyce said in an interview on Thursday that the Chinese hacking campaign was "unacceptable" because the hackers sought access to networks that might allow them to disrupt critical services in the future.</p><p>Joyce said the NSA had been investigating the Chinese hacking effort since last year, and was still trying to verify that Chinese hackers had been kicked out of networks they had broken into. He also said the NSA had been working with other government agencies and private sector partners to share information and provide guidance on how to defend against the threat.</p><p>The US and its allies immediately amplified Microsoft's findings on Wednesday and urged infrastructure operators to check their networks for compromise. The White House also issued a statement condemning China's "irresponsible and destabilizing behavior" in cyberspace, and calling on China to adhere to international norms and laws.</p><p>The Chinese government denied the allegations and accused the US of conducting hacking operations in China. It also said it was a victim of cyberattacks from the US and other countries, and that it was willing to cooperate with other countries on cybersecurity issues based on mutual respect and trust.</p><h2>Cyber tensions add to US-China rivalry in the Pacific</h2><p>The cyberattacks by Chinese hackers add to the ongoing tensions between the US and China over a range of issues, including trade, human rights, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea.</p><p>The US has been strengthening its military presence and alliances in the Pacific region to counter China's growing influence and assertiveness. The US has also been supporting Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and democracy amid China's threats of reunification by force.</p><p>China has been expanding its military and economic power in the region, building artificial islands and military bases in disputed waters, conducting frequent air and naval patrols near Taiwan and Japan, and launching ambitious projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p>The cyberattacks by Chinese hackers also raise concerns that China could be using its cyber capabilities in anticipation of a future conflict with the US in the Pacific. Some analysts have warned that China could launch cyberattacks on US military communications, satellites, power grids, or other critical infrastructure in a crisis scenario.</p><h6>China, cyberattacks, US computer networks</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
