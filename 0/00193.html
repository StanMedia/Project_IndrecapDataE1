Many people have experienced stress, anxiety, depression, anger, loneliness, and other negative emotions as a result of the pandemic. According to a survey conducted by the Taiwan Society of Psychiatry in 2020, more than 40% of Taiwanese adults reported moderate to severe psychological distress during the pandemic, and nearly 30% had symptoms of depression or anxiety.</p><p>The pandemic has also affected people's daily routines, social interactions, work, and education. Some people have faced difficulties in adapting to the changes, such as working from home, online learning, social distancing, and quarantine. Others have suffered from economic losses, job insecurity, family conflicts, or health problems due to the pandemic. These factors can increase the risk of developing mental health issues or exacerbating existing ones.</p><h2>How to self-rescue and build a protective shield for yourself?</h2><p>In order to cope with emotional distress and maintain mental well-being during the pandemic, it is important to adopt some self-care strategies and seek professional help if needed. The Taiwanese health website CommonHealth.com.tw has published an article titled "Falling into an emotional slump, how to self-rescue and build a protective shield for yourself?", which offers some tips and insights on how to deal with negative emotions. Here are some of the main points from the article:</p><ul><li>Recognize and accept your emotions. It is normal to feel sad, angry, scared, or frustrated during the pandemic. Do not suppress or deny your feelings, but acknowledge them and express them in healthy ways. You can talk to someone you trust, write a journal, draw a picture, or do something creative to vent your emotions.</li><li>Seek social support. You are not alone in this situation. Reach out to your family, friends, colleagues, or community members who can offer you emotional support, practical assistance, or companionship. You can also join online groups or forums that share your interests or concerns. Avoid isolating yourself or withdrawing from social activities.</li><li>Maintain a balanced lifestyle. Try to keep a regular schedule of sleeping, eating, working, studying, and relaxing. Eat nutritious food, drink enough water, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol or drugs. Find some hobbies or activities that make you happy and relaxed, such as reading, listening to music, gardening, or meditating. Limit your exposure to negative news or information that may trigger your anxiety or stress.</li><li>Cultivate a positive mindset. Focus on the things that you can control or change in your situation, rather than dwelling on the things that you cannot. Set realistic and achievable goals for yourself and celebrate your progress. Practice gratitude for what you have and what you have accomplished. Look for the silver lining or the opportunity in every challenge.</li><li>Seek professional help if necessary. If your negative emotions persist or interfere with your daily functioning, do not hesitate to seek professional help from a mental health provider. There are many resources and services available online or offline that can offer you counseling, therapy, medication, or other forms of treatment. You do not have to suffer in silence or cope alone.</li></ul><h6>emotional distress, pandemic, self-care, strategies, tips</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
