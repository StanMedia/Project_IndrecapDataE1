It can be prescribed by doctors for severe pain, but it is also illegally manufactured and mixed with other drugs such as heroin and cocaine.</p><p>According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), most of the illicit fentanyl and its variants that enter the US come from China, either directly or through Mexico. China is also a major source of the building blocks of fentanyl, known as fentanyl precursors, which are chemicals that can be used to synthesize the drug.</p><p>The US Treasury Department has designated several Chinese entities and individuals as "significant foreign narcotics traffickers" under the Kingpin Act, which freezes their assets and prohibits US persons from doing business with them.</p><p>The Treasury Department has also imposed sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, which targets foreign persons who play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.</p><p>The US State Department has also offered rewards of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Chinese nationals who are accused of being major fentanyl traffickers.</p><h2>US fails to curb fentanyl precursors from China</h2><p>However, despite these sanctions and other efforts, the US is still facing a surge of fentanyl precursors that are smuggled into the country or ordered online from China.</p><p>A CNN investigation found that at least one China-based company that had links to a sanctioned entity was still offering to ship potential ingredients for fentanyl to the US. The seller, who went by the name Linda Wang, was curt when asked if she sold a chemical often used to create fentanyl.</p><p>"That's banned," Wang replied, before quickly providing an alternative: "CAS79099 powder is best. U can have a try."</p><p>CAS79099 is a code name for a chemical that is not explicitly banned in China or the US, but can be used to make fentanyl or other synthetic opioids. Wang also claimed that she had a warehouse in the US where she could ship the powder from.</p><p>The CNN investigation also revealed how easy it was to find online sellers of fentanyl precursors from China, using platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Alibaba. Some sellers even advertised their products with pictures of pills or bags of powder.</p><p>The challenge of controlling fentanyl precursors is that there are many different chemicals that can be used to make fentanyl and other illicit drugs. Most such precursors also have legitimate uses, such as for medical research or industrial purposes, and are perfectly legal to sell and buy.</p><p>The US has tried to persuade China to ban more fentanyl precursors or regulate them more strictly, but Beijing has been reluctant to do so. China has argued that it is not responsible for the US's drug problem and that it has already taken steps to crack down on fentanyl production and trade.</p><p>China has also accused the US of politicizing the issue and using it as a bargaining chip in trade talks or other disputes. The cooperation between the two countries on anti-drug matters has stalled amid disagreements on human rights, Covid-19, Taiwan and other issues.</p><h2>US faces a deadly overdose crisis</h2><p>The influx of fentanyl precursors from China has contributed to a deadly overdose crisis in the US. More than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2020, and two-thirds of the fatalities involved synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyl and its variants, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Fentanyl is often mixed with other drugs without the users' knowledge, increasing the risk of overdose. Fentanyl can also be laced with other substances, such as xylazine, an animal tranquilizer that can cause respiratory depression and skin lesions.</p><p>The overdose crisis has worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic, as many people have faced increased stress, isolation and economic hardship. The pandemic has also disrupted drug treatment and prevention services and made it harder for people to access help.</p><p>The Biden administration has vowed to tackle the overdose crisis as a public health priority. It has proposed to increase funding for substance use disorder treatment and recovery programs, expand access to medication-assisted treatment, naloxone and syringe services programs, and support evidence-based prevention strategies.</p><p>The administration has also pledged to work with China and other countries to disrupt the global supply of fentanyl and its precursors, and to pursue diplomatic and law enforcement cooperation to combat the illicit drug trade.</p><p>However, experts say that more needs to be done to address the root causes of addiction and overdose, such as poverty, trauma, mental health issues and social isolation. They also call for more research and innovation to develop safer and more effective treatments for opioid use disorder and pain management.</p><p>Fentanyl and its precursors pose a complex and evolving challenge for the US and the world. The US will need a comprehensive and coordinated response that balances public health and public safety, and that involves all levels of government, civil society, private sector and international partners.</p><h6>Fentanyl, China</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
