However, it upheld two complaints relating to incidents that occurred in 2019 and 2020, when Raab was foreign secretary.</p><p>In one incident, Raab was accused of throwing a folder at a senior official during a meeting in his office. The report found that Raab had "acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. It also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates."</p><p>In another incident, Raab was accused of making derogatory remarks about another senior official during a video conference with overseas staff. The report found that Raab had "acted in a way which was undermining or humiliating by making comments which were disrespectful and dismissive of [the official's] professional abilities and experience."</p><p>The report concluded that Raab's conduct amounted to bullying under the civil service definition, which states that bullying is "offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour involving an abuse or misuse of power that can make a person feel vulnerable, upset, humiliated, undermined or threatened."</p><h2>The resignation and the reaction</h2><p>Raab said he called for the inquiry and undertook to resign if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. He said he believed it was important to keep his word.</p><p>He added that he disagreed with the report's findings and methodology, and that he believed it set a "dangerous precedent" by setting the threshold for bullying "so low".</p><p>He also defended his record as a minister and said he had always treated his staff with respect and courtesy.</p><p>"I have been privileged to serve as foreign secretary and first secretary of state during one of the most challenging periods for British foreign policy since the end of the Cold War," he said in his resignation letter.</p><p>"I am proud of what we achieved on Brexit, securing global Britain's place in the world, standing up for our values and interests, and delivering for the British people."</p><p>Sunak said he accepted Raab's resignation with "great sadness" and praised his contribution to the government.</p><p>"Dominic has been an outstanding colleague and friend. He has served this country with distinction as foreign secretary and deputy prime minister," Sunak said in a statement.</p><p>"He has been instrumental in shaping our global Britain agenda, championing human rights and democracy around the world, and strengthening our alliances with our closest partners."</p><p>Sunak also said he respected Raab's decision to resign and thanked him for his "integrity and honour".</p><p>Sunak later appointed Oliver Dowden, the former culture secretary, as his new deputy prime minister and justice secretary.</p><p>The opposition Labour Party said Raab's resignation was overdue and called for a wider investigation into bullying allegations across the government.</p><p>Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said Sunak should have sacked Raab rather than letting him resign.</p><p>"Dominic Raab should have gone months ago for his catastrophic failures over Afghanistan," Starmer said.</p><p>"Instead of showing leadership today by sacking him for bullying staff, Rishi Sunak has allowed Dominic Raab to resign with his dignity intact," Starmer said.</p><p>"This is yet another example of a weak prime minister who is unable to tackle the sleaze and scandal that is engulfing his government."</p><p>Sunak's government has been hit by a series of scandals involving senior ministers and lawmakers in recent months, eroding public trust and confidence in his leadership.</p><p>In October 2022, Sunak's predecessor Boris Johnson resigned after multiple allegations of misconduct, including breaking Covid-19 rules, misusing public funds, lying to Parliament and having an affair with a former aide.</p><p>In November 2022, Sunak's first choice for chancellor, Liz Truss, quit after six weeks in office when her tax-cutting economic plans sparked mayhem on the financial markets and triggered a backlash from businesses and voters.</p><p>In December 2022, Sunak's health secretary Sajid Javid resigned after admitting he breached Covid-19 rules by attending a Christmas party at Downing Street in 2020, when such gatherings were banned.</p><p>In January 2023, Sunak's education secretary Nadhim Zahawi resigned after he was accused of sexually harassing a female journalist at a Conservative Party conference.</p><p>In February 2023, Sunak's defence secretary Ben Wallace resigned after he was accused of leaking confidential information about a military operation to a friend who worked as a lobbyist.</p><p>In March 2023, Sunak's environment secretary George Eustice resigned after he was accused of abusing his position to help his brother's farming business secure lucrative contracts.</p><p>In April 2023, Sunak's deputy prime minister Dominic Raab resigned after he was found to have bullied officials.</p><h2>The implications for the future</h2><p>Raab's resignation is a serious blow to Sunak's premiership, as he loses one of his closest allies and a key figure in his government.</p><p>Raab was seen as a loyal supporter of Sunak and his agenda of delivering Brexit, pursuing an ambitious global Britain strategy and reforming the justice system.</p><p>Raab was also seen as a potential successor to Sunak, as he had a strong base of support among Conservative Party members and lawmakers who share his hardline views on Brexit and foreign policy.</p><p>Raab's departure could weaken Sunak's position within his party and open up space for rival factions and leadership contenders to challenge him.</p><p>Sunak faces growing discontent from some Conservative lawmakers who are unhappy with his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy, the health service and the environment.</p><p>Sunak also faces mounting pressure from the opposition Labour Party, which has been gaining ground in opinion polls and hopes to capitalise on the public anger over the government's scandals and failures.</p><p>Sunak will need to act swiftly and decisively to restore trust and confidence in his government and to show that he can deliver on his promises to the British people.</p><p>He will also need to find a new deputy prime minister who can work effectively with him and support him in leading the country through the challenges ahead.</p><h6>UK politics, Dominic Raab, Rishi Sunak</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
