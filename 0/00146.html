Last year the ministry announced 11,000 people and 131 types of weapons were involved in the military parade, with an airshow of 77 aircraft and helicopters.</p><p>In his speech at the parade, Putin accused Western countries of "trying to rewrite history" and "undermine Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity". He claimed that Russia was facing "unprecedented threats" and vowed to defend its national interests.</p><p>"We are not only celebrating the sacred Victory Day, but also our will to defend our homeland, our sovereignty and our independence. We are ready to do everything for this," he said.</p><p>He also praised the Russian people for their resilience and solidarity in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.</p><p>"We have overcome all difficulties and hardships thanks to our unity and mutual support. We have shown that together we can overcome any challenge," he said.</p><h2>Putin faces international isolation</h2><p>However, Putin's defiant rhetoric contrasted with his diplomatic isolation amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014 and displaced millions more.</p><p>Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has been supporting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine ever since. In April 2023, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sparking international condemnation and sanctions.</p><p>The United States and its allies have accused Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as international law and human rights. They have also expressed concern about Russia's use of drones, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns to destabilize Ukraine and undermine its democracy.</p><p>The US and its NATO partners have pledged to support Ukraine's security and sovereignty, as well as its aspirations to join the transatlantic alliance. They have also increased their military presence and assistance in the region, including providing lethal weapons, training and intelligence to Ukrainian forces.</p><p>On Monday, US President Joe Biden announced that he would host a summit of democracy in Washington in July, where he would invite leaders from around the world to discuss how to counter authoritarianism and corruption. He said that Russia was among the countries that posed a threat to democracy and human rights.</p><p>"We must demonstrate with our actions that democracy can deliver for our people and for people around the world," Biden said. "We must prove that democracy can prevail over autocracy."</p><p>Biden also said that he would meet with Putin in Geneva on June 16 to discuss a range of issues, including strategic stability, arms control, human rights and regional conflicts. He said that he would seek a stable and predictable relationship with Russia, but also make clear that there would be consequences for its aggressive actions.</p><p>"I will make clear to President Putin that there are areas where we can cooperate if he chooses. And if he chooses not to cooperate and acts in a way that he has in the past relative to cybersecurity and some other activities, then we will respond," Biden said.</p><h2>Putin faces domestic discontent</h2><p>Putin also faced growing discontent at home over his handling of the war in Ukraine, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.</p><p>According to a recent poll by the independent Levada Center, Putin's approval rating fell to 59% in April 2023, down from 69% in January approval rating fell to 59% in April 2023, down from 69% in January. The decline was attributed to the public dissatisfaction with the war in Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.</p><p>According to another poll by the independent Levada Center, 49% of Russians said they were ready to protest against the war in Ukraine, while 45% said they were not. The poll also found that 56% of Russians believed that Russia should stop the war and withdraw its troops from Ukraine, while 37% disagreed.</p><p>The war in Ukraine has also sparked criticism from some of Russia's elite, including oligarchs, politicians and media figures. In March 2023, billionaire Mikhail Fridman publicly denounced Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, calling it a "strategic mistake" that would damage Russia's economy and international reputation. He also urged Putin to negotiate with Ukraine and end the conflict peacefully.</p><p>In April 2023, a leaked audio recording revealed that Dmitry Utkin, the leader of Wagner Group, a private military company linked to the Kremlin, threatened to kill some of Putin's top military commanders for their incompetence and cowardice in the war. He also accused them of abandoning Wagner fighters on the battlefield and lying to Putin about the situation on the ground.</p><p>In May 2023, a group of prominent Russian journalists published an open letter to Putin, calling on him to stop the war and respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They also expressed their solidarity with their Ukrainian colleagues who have been harassed, arrested and killed by Russian forces and their proxies.</p><h2>Putin's Victory Day parade lacks foreign guests</h2><p>Another sign of Putin's isolation was the lack of foreign guests at his Victory Day parade. Only a handful of world leaders attended the event, most of them from former Soviet republics or allies of Russia.</p><p>Among them were Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has faced mass protests and international sanctions over his disputed re-election and brutal crackdown on dissent; Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, who has ruled his country with an iron fist since 1994; Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, who came to power after a violent uprising in 2020; Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who succeeded longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2019; Moldovan President Igor Dodon, who lost his re-election bid in 2020 but remains close to Moscow; and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who survived a coup attempt in February 2023 after signing a peace deal with Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p><p>Other foreign dignitaries who attended the parade included Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has balanced his ties with Russia and the West; Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who inherited the leadership of the communist island from Raul Castro in 2019; Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has relied on Russian military support to survive a decade-long civil war; and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has faced US-backed opposition and sanctions over his authoritarian rule.</p><p>However, many other world leaders who have attended Putin's Victory Day parades in the past were absent this year. They included Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has been Putin's closest ally and partner in challenging US hegemony; Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has maintained a strategic partnership with Russia despite growing ties with the US; French President Emmanuel Macron, who has sought dialogue with Putin on various issues despite their differences; and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has pursued a peace treaty with Russia over a territorial dispute.</p><p>The absence of these leaders reflected their disapproval of Putin's aggression in Ukraine and their support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They also showed their solidarity with other European countries that have boycotted Putin's parade over his annexation of Crimea and his interference in eastern Ukraine.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Putin's Victory Day parade was meant to showcase his strength and legitimacy as Russia's leader. However, it also revealed his isolation and vulnerability amid the war in Ukraine and the challenges he faces at home and abroad.</p><p>While Putin may enjoy high approval ratings among some segments of the Russian population, he also faces growing discontent and criticism from others who are unhappy with his policies and actions. He also faces international pressure and sanctions from Western countries that have condemned his violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>Putin may claim that he is defending Russia's national interests and historical legacy against Western aggression. But he may also be risking Russia's future and reputation by pursuing a pursuing a costly and unpopular war that has alienated many of his former friends and partners.</p><h6>Putin, Victory Day, Ukraine, Russia, isolation</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
