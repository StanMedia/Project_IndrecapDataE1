He declined to give further details about the mission, saying it was not yet public.</p><p>"The mission is in the course now, but it is not yet public. When it is public, I will reveal it," Francis told reporters on board his plane as he returned to Rome after a three-day visit to Hungary and Slovakia.</p><p>He said he had spoken about the situation in Ukraine with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and with Metropolitan Hilarion, a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church in Budapest. He also met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal at the Vatican last week and discussed a "peace formula" proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p><p>"I think that peace is always made by opening channels. You can never achieve peace through closure. ... This is not easy," he said.</p><p>He added that he was willing to do everything that has to be done to help bring peace to Ukraine. He also expressed his wish to visit Kyiv and Moscow on a peace mission.</p><h2>Pope's concern for Ukraine</h2><p>Pope Francis has repeatedly expressed his concern for the suffering of the people of Ukraine and called for dialogue and respect for international law to resolve the conflict. He has also offered humanitarian aid and spiritual support to the victims of the war.</p><p>In February 2022, he held a special collection in Catholic churches around the world for Ukraine, raising more than $10 million. He also sent a delegation of Vatican officials and bishops to visit the war-torn regions of eastern Ukraine and meet with local religious leaders and civil authorities.</p><p>In March 2022, he met with Zelenskiy at the Vatican and praised his efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis. He also urged him to foster national unity and reconciliation.</p><p>In April 2022, he celebrated Easter Mass in St. Peter's Basilica and prayed for peace in Ukraine. He said he was following with "deep concern" the escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and appealed for dialogue and respect for international law.</p><h2>Background of the war in Ukraine</h2><p>The war in Ukraine began in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula on the Black Sea that belonged to Ukraine. Russia also backed separatist rebels who took control of parts of eastern Ukraine, mainly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p><p>The conflict has been fueled by political, historical, ethnic, linguistic and religious differences between Ukraine and Russia, as well as by geopolitical interests and rivalries.</p><p>Several attempts to end the war have been made through diplomatic negotiations, mediated by France and Germany, known as the Minsk process. The main agreements reached in Minsk in 2015 included a ceasefire, a withdrawal of heavy weapons, an exchange of prisoners, local elections and constitutional reforms.</p><p>However, the implementation of these agreements has been slow and incomplete, as both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire and other commitments. The war has continued with sporadic clashes and casualties along the front line.</p><p>The situation worsened in early 2023, when Russia amassed tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine, raising fears of a possible invasion or escalation of hostilities. The US and its allies expressed their support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and warned Russia against any aggression.</p><p>Russia said its troop movements were part of routine exercises and accused Ukraine of provoking tensions by seeking NATO membership and increasing its military presence in the region. Russia also said it was ready for dialogue but demanded respect for its interests and security.</p><p>The crisis eased somewhat in late April 2023, when Russia announced it was withdrawing some of its forces from the border area. However, both sides remained on high alert and urged each other to de-escalate further.</p><h2>Pope's appeals for peace and humanitarian aid</h2><p>Pope Francis has repeatedly appealed for peace and humanitarian aid for the people of Ukraine, who have suffered from the war and its consequences. He has also expressed his solidarity and closeness with the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which is in full communion with Rome.</p><p>In February 2022, he held a special collection in Catholic churches around the world for Ukraine, raising more than $10 million. He also sent a delegation of Vatican officials and bishops to visit the war-torn regions of eastern Ukraine and meet with local religious leaders and civil authorities.</p><p>In March 2022, he met with Zelenskiy at the Vatican and praised his efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis. He also urged him to foster national unity and reconciliation.</p><p>In April 2022, he celebrated Easter Mass in St. Peter's Basilica and prayed for peace in Ukraine. He said he was following with "deep concern" the escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and appealed for dialogue and respect for international law.</p><p>In May 2022, he spoke of a secret peace mission that the Vatican is involved in to try to end the conflict. He said he was willing to do everything that has to be done and that he would reveal the details when it is public.</p><p>He also said he was willing to help facilitate the return of Ukrainian children taken to Russia by their parents or relatives who joined the separatist rebels. He said the Holy See had already helped mediate some prisoner exchanges and would do "all that is humanly possible" to reunite families.</p><p>He also heard testimony from refugees – many from Ukraine – and appealed to the importance of charity during his visit to Hungary. He said he was moved by their stories of suffering and hope.</p><h6>Pope Francis, Vatican, peace mission, Ukraine, Russia</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
