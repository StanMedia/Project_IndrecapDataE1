It also said it had "moderate confidence" that Covid-19 was not genetically engineered or artificially manipulated.</p><p>The department acknowledged that its assessment was not definitive and that it faced significant gaps and uncertainties in its information. It also said it welcomed further investigation and collaboration with other experts and agencies to reach a more conclusive answer.</p><p>The department's assessment is part of a broader US effort in which intelligence agencies were asked by President Joe Biden in 2021 to examine the origins of the coronavirus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. That overall assessment from the intelligence community was inconclusive, and then, as now, there has yet to be a decisive link established between the virus and a specific animal or other route – as China continues to stonewall international investigations into the origins of the virus.</p><h2>The reactions and implications of the US intelligence claim</h2><p>The US Department of Energy's claim has been greeted with mixed reactions from experts, policymakers, and media outlets around the world. Some have supported it as a credible and plausible explanation for the origins of Covid-19, while others have challenged it as invalid and unreliable.</p><p>Some experts have said that the department's claim is consistent with the available scientific evidence and that it raises legitimate concerns about the potential role of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in the outbreak. They have also said that the claim reflects the growing consensus among scientists that the lab leak theory cannot be ruled out and that it deserves further investigation.</p><p>However, other experts have said that the department's claim is based on weak and circumstantial evidence and that it does not provide any new or conclusive information to support its claim. They have also said that the claim relies on assumptions and speculation rather than facts and data and that it ignores alternative explanations for the origins of Covid-19.</p><p>Some policymakers and media outlets have used the department's claim as a basis to call for more pressure and accountability on China to cooperate with international efforts to trace the origins of Covid-19. They have also used it as a way to criticize China's handling of the outbreak and its lack of transparency and cooperation.</p><p>However, other policymakers and media outlets have cautioned against jumping to conclusions based on the department's claim and have urged for more dialogue and cooperation with China to resolve the issue. They have also warned against politicizing or sensationalizing the issue of Covid-19 origins and have called for more scientific and objective investigations based on evidence and facts.</p><p>China, meanwhile, has dismissed the US Department of Energy's claim and the US intelligence report as a whole, saying they are based on lies and fabrications and that they aim to smear and scapegoat China for the pandemic.</p><p>China has accused the US of politicizing the issue of Covid-19 origins and of using intelligence agencies to interfere in scientific research. China has also accused the US of being hypocritical and double-standard, saying that the US has not been transparent or cooperative with its own investigations into its own labs and outbreaks.</p><p>China has also reiterated its own claims and counterclaims on Covid-19 origins, saying that it has been open and responsible in sharing information and facilitating international cooperation. China has also said that it has conducted thorough and comprehensive investigations into its own labs and markets and that it has found no evidence of a lab leak or animal source in China.</p><p>China has also suggested that the virus may have originated elsewhere, such as in the US or Europe, and that it may have been introduced into China by imported frozen food or foreign military personnel. China has also called for investigations into other labs around the world, especially the US military lab at Fort Detrick in Maryland, which it alleges may have links to the pandemic.</p><p>China has also criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) for being biased and influenced by the US and its allies. China has said that it does not accept or recognize the WHO's plan for a second phase of studies into Covid-19 origins, which includes audits of labs and markets in China. China has said that it will only cooperate with WHO on the basis of mutual respect and consultation and that it will only support origin-tracing efforts that are scientific, objective, fair, and inclusive.</p><h2>The challenges and prospects for Covid-19 origin-tracing</h2><p>The US Department of Energy's claim and the US intelligence report have added more fuel to the already heated debate and controversy over Covid-19 origins. They have also deepened the rift and mistrust between the US and China, as well as between China and other countries that support further investigations into China's role in the pandemic.</p><p>The conflicting claims and narratives from different sides have made it more difficult to reach a consensus and cooperation on Covid-19 origin-tracing, which is essential for understanding how the pandemic started and how to prevent future outbreaks. The politicization and sensationalization of the issue have also undermined the credibility and authority of scientific research and international organizations, such as WHO, that are supposed to lead and coordinate origin-tracing efforts.</p><p>The challenges and prospects for Covid-19 origin-tracing depend largely on how the US, China, WHO, and other stakeholders will handle the issue in the coming months. Will they be able to overcome their differences and suspicions and work together to find a common ground and a common goal? Will they be able to respect each other's concerns and interests and seek a balanced and comprehensive approach to origin-tracing? Will they be able to put aside their prejudices and agendas and follow the science and facts wherever they lead?</p><p>The answers to these questions will not only determine how much we will learn about Covid-19 origins, but also how much we will be able to prevent another pandemic from happening again.</p><h6>Covid-19, origins, US, China, intelligence</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
