Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly disclosed the news during a heated exchange in Ottawa with opposition lawmaker Michael Chong, now at the center of the accusations against China.</p><p>Chong was allegedly targeted for harassment by Beijing, and has fiercely criticized the slow response of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government. Joly also told members of parliament during a foreign affairs committee session that Canada is considering taking retaliatory action against China and that "all options are on the table" – including diplomatic expulsions.</p><p>However, she admitted Canada's government was carefully weighing the possibility of retaliation by China, which denies interfering in Canadian political affairs.</p><p>"Of course China and the PRC (People's Republic of China) will take action (against) these interests including economic interest, consumer interest and also diplomatic interest, will be affected and therefore–but it's about also the interests of the country so as we are assessing the interest and I know that we are under pressure to go fast we need to make sure as well that we protect our democracy," said Joly.</p><p>As first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) found that Chong and his relatives in China were targeted for harassment by an accredited Chinese diplomat in the country. CSIS also said that Beijing had tried to sway the outcome of Canada's federal elections in 2019 and 2021.</p><p>China's embassy in Ottawa did not release a statement and did not respond to a request for comment. CNN asked China's foreign ministry about the allegations, specifically the accusations made by CSIS about political interference and attempts at intimidation made by a Chinese diplomat.</p><p>"China always opposes any country's interference in other countries internal affairs. We have never had and have no interest in interfering in Canada's internal affairs. At the same time, China firmly upholds its own sovereignty, security, and development interests and firmly opposes any act that interferes with China's internal affairs and harms China's interests," said the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning during a foreign affairs ministry briefing Wednesday.</p><h2>Canada says foreign efforts to subvert elections failed</h2><p>The allegations of Chinese interference come as an independent review released on Tuesday found that foreign governments tried to interfere with the last two federal elections in Canada, but they did not succeed in "impacting" the voting results.</p><p>The report was a review of the work of a special panel of five senior public servants, created to work with intelligence and law enforcement agencies to alert the public to any "incidents that threaten the integrity of a federal election."</p><p>Morris Rosenberg, the former deputy justice minister who wrote the report, said the panel had "determined that the government of Canada did not detect foreign interference that threatened Canada's ability to have free and fair elections," adding: "National security agencies saw attempts at foreign interference, but not enough to have met the threshold of impacting electoral integrity."</p><p>The report singles out China, Russia and Iran as having tried to interfere in the votes held in 2019 and 2021, and it indicates that social media sites were important tools to that end. It makes particular note of activity by China.</p><p>It says that CSIS was concerned that "China notably tried to target elected officials to promote their national interests and encouraged individuals to act as proxies." China's techniques, the agency told Rosenberg, included threatening members of the Chinese community in Canada.</p><p>The reports cites an editorial in Global Times — a Chinese Communist Party-run newspaper — that falsely suggested that the Conservative Party "almost wants to break diplomatic relations with China." It also notes a post on the Chinese messaging app WeChat, which made the claim that a bill to establish a registry of individuals lobbying for foreign governments — introduced by Kenny Chiu, who sought re-election in 2021 as a Conservative — "suppresses the Chinese community." Chiu was defeated by a candidate from Trudeau's Liberal Party.</p><p>While the report said the foreign efforts had not affected election integrity, it added that it was difficult to precisely measure the total effect of Chinese disinformation on election results.</p><h2>Canada-China relations remain tense amid human rights disputes</h2><p>The latest developments add more strain to the already tense relations between Canada and China, which have deteriorated since 2018 when Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at Huawei Technologies Co Ltd., on a US extradition request related to alleged violations of US sanctions against Iran. Meng denied any wrongdoing and fought the extradition in Canadian courts.</p><p>In a surprise development on Friday, Meng reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice, which allowed her to return to China after nearly three years of legal limbo. The deal required Meng to admit that she made false statements to a bank about Huawei's dealings with Iran, but also allowed her to avoid a criminal conviction in the US.</p><p>Meng's release was celebrated in China as a diplomatic victory and a sign of the country's strength and resilience. She was greeted by a cheering crowd of supporters and media at the Shenzhen airport on Saturday, where she thanked the Chinese government and people for their support.</p><p>"I'm finally back to my motherland," she said. "As an ordinary Chinese citizen, I feel proud and honored."</p><p>Meng also expressed her gratitude to Canada for its "fair and just judicial system" and its "kindness and empathy." She said she hoped that China and Canada could improve their relations in the future.</p><h2>Canada welcomes release of two Michaels</h2><p>Meng's departure from Canada was followed by the release of two Canadian citizens who had been detained in China since December 2018, shortly after Meng's arrest. Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, were accused of espionage and sentenced to 11 years in prison each. Both men denied the charges and their cases were widely seen as retaliation by China for Meng's arrest.</p><p>The two men boarded a Canadian government plane in Beijing on Friday night and arrived in Calgary on Saturday morning, where they were reunited with their families and friends. They were also greeted by Prime Minister Trudeau, who hugged them and expressed his relief and joy.</p><p>"These two men have been through an unbelievably difficult ordeal. For the past 1,000 days, they have shown strength, perseverance and grace and we are all inspired by that," Trudeau said.</p><p>Trudeau also thanked US President Joe Biden and his administration for their "tireless" efforts to secure the release of the two Michaels. He said Canada's allies had shown "solidarity" and "resolve" in standing up for the rule of law and human rights.</p><p>"We will continue to work with our allies around the world to ensure that all countries respect international rules and norms so that we can all build a better future together," Trudeau said.</p><h2>Analysis: A diplomatic breakthrough or a fragile truce?</h2><p>The resolution of the Meng Wanzhou affair marks a significant breakthrough in the strained relations between Canada, China and the US. It also ends a long ordeal for the individuals involved and their families.</p><p>However, it does not necessarily signal a lasting improvement in the geopolitical tensions that have been simmering for years. The underlying issues that sparked the dispute — such as Huawei's role in global telecommunications, US sanctions on Iran, China's human rights record, and Canada's position as a middle power — remain unresolved.</p><p>Some analysts have suggested that the deal was motivated by pragmatic considerations rather than principled ones. The US may have wanted to avoid a lengthy and uncertain trial that could have damaged its relations with China further. China may have wanted to ease some of the international pressure and criticism it has faced over its treatment of the two Michaels. Canada may have wanted to end its role as a pawn in a larger conflict between two superpowers.</p><p>Others have argued that the deal was a result of effective diplomacy and cooperation among allies. They point out that the US did not drop the charges against Meng or Huawei, but rather reached a legal agreement that held them accountable. They also note that Canada did not cave in to China's demands or compromise its judicial independence, but rather followed its due process until the end.</p><p>Regardless of how one views the deal, it is clear that it has opened a window of opportunity for dialogue and engagement among the three countries. Whether this opportunity will be seized or squandered remains to be seen.</p><h6>Canada, China, US, Meng Wanzhou, Michael Kovrig, Michael Spavor</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
