The visit marks Brazil's return to the diplomatic stage among the Global South, after four years of isolation and turmoil under his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.</p><p>Lula, who was president from 2003 to 2010, is widely regarded as one of Brazil's most popular and influential leaders. He oversaw a period of economic growth, social inclusion and international prestige for Brazil, and forged strong ties with China and other emerging powers.</p><p>His visit comes at a time when both Brazil and China are facing multiple challenges, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and the geopolitical tensions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><h2>Trade and investment top the agenda</h2><p>The main focus of Lula's visit will be on trade and investment, as both countries seek to deepen their economic cooperation and recover from the pandemic-induced recession.</p><p>China has been Brazil's main trading partner since 2009, importing almost $90 billion worth of Brazilian commodities - soy, iron ore, petrol - last year alone. At the same time, Brazil is the second largest recipient of Chinese public investment in Latin America and the largest single-market for Chinese products in South America.</p><p>Lula's delegation aims to seal 20 different bilateral deals, including a framework for Brazilian banks to operate in yuan to facilitate business. His state visit follows a pilgrimage by hundreds of Brazilian business leaders to Beijing last month; Lula had been expected to make the same trip but postponed due to health reasons.</p><p>Lula has also expressed his interest in joining the Belt and Road Initiative, China's ambitious global infrastructure project that aims to connect Asia, Europe and Africa. Bolsonaro had rejected the initiative, fearing it would undermine Brazil's sovereignty and security.</p><h2>Carbon credits offer new opportunities</h2><p>Another major topic that will be discussed during Lula's visit is the carbon market, with energy and the environment top of mind in both Beijing and Brasilia.</p><p>China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, while Brazil is home to the Amazon rainforest, which plays a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and regulating the global climate. Both countries have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 and 2050 respectively, as part of their commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The market for carbon credits allows countries that emit low amounts of CO2 to sell some of their emissions allowance to other countries, allowing bigger polluters to "offset" their emissions. This creates an incentive for countries to reduce their emissions and invest in clean energy sources.</p><p>Brazil has a huge potential to generate carbon credits from its vast natural resources, such as forests, wetlands and renewable energy. China, on the other hand, has a huge demand for carbon credits to meet its emission reduction targets and avoid international sanctions.</p><p>"There are great opportunities in the carbon credit market for Chinese companies looking to cut their emissions, and Brazilian institutions trying to sell these schemes," says Renato Ungaretti, a resident fellow at Observa China, a Brazilian think-tank focused on studying Sino-Brazilian relationships.</p><p>The two economic giants are "complementary" when it comes to carbon trading, Ungaretti told CNN. "There's some expectation for Brazil and China to sign a joint statement around the climate crisis," he added.</p><h2>Ukraine crisis not on the official program</h2><p>While trade and carbon credits will dominate the agenda of Lula's visit, one issue that will likely be avoided is the Ukraine crisis, which has sparked global condemnation and concern over Russia's aggression.</p><p>Lula had previously vowed to discuss peacemaking strategies with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is seen as a key ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin. However, according to Igor Patrick, a research scholar at the Kissinger Institute on China at the Wilson Centre, removing Ukraine from the list of things that they're going to discuss was a demand from the Chinese government.</p><p>"There's still some interest from the Brazilian part to raise the issue and to discuss ideas, and they hope to release a joint statement where they mention the Ukrainian conflict, calls for a peaceful solution and mediated diplomatically, but it's not officially on the program and to a large extent that was expectable," Patrick told CNN.</p><p>China has adopted a cautious stance on the Ukraine crisis, calling for dialogue and restraint and avoiding taking sides. China has also expressed its opposition to any external interference in Ukraine's internal affairs, a position that echoes its own sensitivity over issues such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.</p><p>Brazil, on the other hand, has condemned Russia's actions and expressed its solidarity with Ukraine, in line with its traditional support for international law and human rights. Brazil has also joined other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia and suspending arms sales.</p><p>However, Lula is unlikely to confront Xi over the Ukraine crisis, as he seeks to maintain a cordial and pragmatic relationship with China. Lula has also been critical of the US-led NATO alliance, which he sees as a threat to global peace and stability.</p><p>Lula's visit to China reflects his vision of a multipolar world order, where Brazil can play an active and independent role in global affairs, without aligning itself with any bloc or power. Lula has also advocated for a reform of the United Nations Security Council, where he hopes Brazil can obtain a permanent seat alongside China.</p><p>Lula's visit to China is expected to boost bilateral ties and cooperation on various fields, such as trade, investment, climate change, health, science and technology. It is also expected to enhance Brazil's role and influence in the Global South, especially among the BRICS group of emerging economies, which also includes Russia, India and South Africa.</p><p>However, Lula's visit to China also reveals a growing distance from the geopolitical questions preoccupying the West, such as the Ukraine crisis, human rights and democracy. Lula may have to balance his interests and values as he navigates the complex and changing global landscape.</p><h6>Trade, Carbon Credits, Ukraine, Lula, Xi</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
