Chris Hipkins, 44, was sworn in at a ceremony in Wellington, becoming the country's 42nd prime minister and the leader of the ruling Labour party.</p><p>Hipkins, who has been a member of parliament since 2008, was previously the minister of education, minister of police, minister for the public service, and leader of the house. He also played a key role in New Zealand's successful response to the Covid-19 pandemic as the minister in charge of the government's testing and vaccination programmes.</p><p>Hipkins was unanimously endorsed by the Labour party caucus on Sunday as Ardern's successor, after she announced on Thursday that she had "no more in the tank" to lead the country and would step down ahead of an election scheduled for November. Ardern said she was leaving for personal reasons and that she wanted to spend more time with her family, especially her four-year-old daughter Neve.</p><p>Ardern, 42, became New Zealand's third female prime minister and one of the youngest leaders in the world when she took office in 2017. She gained global recognition and admiration for her empathetic and decisive leadership during various crises, such as the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, the 2019 White Island volcanic eruption, and the Covid-19 pandemic. She also made history by becoming only the second world leader to give birth while in office.</p><p>Ardern bid an emotional farewell on Tuesday at her last official event as prime minister, a Maori religious festival in Ratana. She thanked New Zealanders for their support and kindness during her tenure and said she was leaving with gratitude and love for her country.</p><p>"I have experienced such love, compassion, empathy and kindness in the job. That has been my predominant experience. So I leave feeling gratitude for having this wonderful role for so many years," Ardern told reporters.</p><p>"I would hate for anyone to view my departure as a negative commentary on New Zealand," she added.</p><p>Ardern also offered some advice to Hipkins, saying "you do you".</p><p>"This is for him now. It's for him to carve out his own space, be his own kind of leader. Actually, there is no advice I can really impart. I can share information, I can share experiences, but this is now for him," she said.</p><p>"You won't find me commenting on domestic politics, I've had my time," Ardern said, adding: "I'm ready to be a backbench MP (member of parliament), I'm ready to be a sister and a mom."</p><p>Hipkins faces several challenges as he takes over as prime minister, including leading the country through the Covid-19 pandemic and preparing for the upcoming election. He will also have to deal with issues such as housing affordability, climate change, child poverty, and Maori rights.</p><p>Hipkins has said he will continue Ardern's legacy of empathy and kindness, but also bring his own style and vision to the role.</p><p>"I'm honoured and humbled to have this opportunity to serve New Zealand as prime minister," Hipkins said after being sworn in.</p><p>"I want to thank Jacinda Ardern for her outstanding leadership and friendship over the years. She has been an inspiration to me and to millions of New Zealanders and people around the world."</p><p>"I also want to thank my family, my colleagues, and my fellow New Zealanders for their support and trust. I will do my best to lead our country with integrity, compassion, and competence."</p><p>"I know we face many challenges as a nation, but I also know we have many strengths and opportunities. I look forward to working with all New Zealanders to build a fairer, greener, and more prosperous future for us all."</p><h2>Ardern's personal life and legacy</h2><p>Ardern was born on July 26, 1980, in Hamilton, New Zealand. Her father, Ross Ardern, was a police officer who later became the high commissioner to Niue, a small island nation in the Pacific. Her mother, Laurell Ardern, was a school catering assistant. Ardern grew up in various towns in New Zealand's North Island, such as Murupara, Morrinsville, and Te Aroha. She has one older sister, Louise Ardern.</p><p>Ardern joined the Labour Party when she was 17 and became involved in politics at an early age. She studied communication studies at the University of Waikato and graduated in 2001. She then worked as a researcher for Labour MP Phil Goff and later for Prime Minister Helen Clark. She also spent time working and volunteering overseas, including in the United Kingdom and New York.</p><p>Ardern was elected to parliament in 2008 as a list MP and became the youngest sitting MP at the time. She held various portfolios in the opposition, such as social development, children, arts and culture, and justice. She also became the president of the International Union of Socialist Youth in 2008.</p><p>In 2017, Ardern became the leader of the Labour Party after Andrew Little resigned. She led her party to a stunning victory in the general election that year, forming a coalition government with the New Zealand First and Green parties. She became New Zealand's third female prime minister and one of the youngest leaders in the world.</p><p>In 2018, Ardern gave birth to her daughter Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford while in office, becoming only the second world leader to do so after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto. Her partner Clarke Gayford, a television presenter and fisherman, became a stay-at-home dad. The couple got engaged in 2019 but had to postpone their wedding plans due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Ardern won a second term in office in 2020 with a landslide victory, securing an outright majority for her party for the first time since New Zealand adopted a proportional representation system in 1996. She continued to lead her country through various challenges, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings, and the climate crisis.</p><p>Ardern surprised many people when she announced her resignation as prime minister in January 2023, citing personal reasons and exhaustion. She said she wanted to spend more time with her family and that she had "no more in the tank" to lead the country for another four years. She received praise and admiration from many people around the world for her empathetic and decisive leadership style and her achievements during her tenure.</p><p>Ardern said she had no plans for her post-political life but that she would remain an MP for Mount Albert until April 2023. She also said she would not comment on domestic politics anymore and that she would support her successor Chris Hipkins as he takes over as prime minister.</p><h6>New Zealand, prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, Chris Hipkins</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
