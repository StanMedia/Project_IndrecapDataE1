It has one of the most successful health care systems in the world, providing universal, comprehensive, and affordable health care to all its citizens. Taiwan's national health insurance (NHI) system, which was launched in 1995, covers more than 99 percent of the population and offers a wide range of benefits, including preventive care, hospital care, prescription drugs, dental care, traditional Chinese medicine, and long-term care. The NHI system is funded mainly by payroll taxes, supplemented by government subsidies and copayments. The system is administered by a single-payer agency, the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), which negotiates fees and budgets with health care providers and monitors the quality and efficiency of health care delivery.</p><h2>Features of Taiwan's Health Insurance System</h2><p>Taiwan's health insurance system has several distinctive features that contribute to its success. Some of these features are:</p><ul><li>A smart card system: Every NHI beneficiary receives a smart card that contains their personal information, medical history, and insurance status. The card is used to access health care services and to store electronic medical records. The card also facilitates billing and reimbursement, reduces administrative costs, and prevents fraud and abuse.</li><li>A global budget system: The NHIA sets an annual global budget for health spending based on projected revenues and expenditures. The budget is allocated to different sectors of health care, such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and dentists. The NHIA also sets fee schedules and payment methods for each sector, such as fee-for-service, capitation, diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), or pay-for-performance. The global budget system helps to control health spending and to incentivize providers to improve quality and efficiency.</li><li>A copayment system: The NHI requires beneficiaries to pay copayments for most health care services, except for preventive care, childbirth, major diseases, low-income households, children under three years old, and veterans. The copayments vary by type and level of service, ranging from NT$50 (US$1.7) for a clinic visit to NT$600 (US$20) for a hospital admission. The copayments are intended to discourage overutilization and to share the cost of health care among beneficiaries.</li><li>A supplementary insurance system: The NHI covers most essential health care services, but some services are excluded or limited, such as cosmetic surgery, organ transplants, experimental treatments, dental implants, and certain drugs. To cover these services or to obtain better quality or convenience of care, some beneficiaries choose to purchase supplementary insurance from private insurers or public organizations. The supplementary insurance market accounts for about 10 percent of total health spending in Taiwan.</li></ul><h2>Achievements and Challenges of Taiwan's Health Insurance System</h2><p>Taiwan's health insurance system has achieved remarkable results in terms of coverage, access, quality, and cost. Some of these achievements are:</p><ul><li>High coverage rate: Taiwan has achieved near-universal health coverage for its population since 1995. According to the NHIA statistics, as of December 2022, there were 23.6 million NHI beneficiaries out of a total population of 23.8 million people, resulting in a coverage rate of 99.2 percent.</li><li>High access rate: Taiwan has a high density of health care providers and facilities, ensuring easy access to health care for its citizens. According to the NHIA statistics, as of December 2022, there were 37.8 physicians and 72.9 hospital beds per 10,000 people in Taiwan, which are higher than the OECD averages of 34.3 physicians and 47.5 hospital beds per 10,000 people. Moreover, the NHI beneficiaries can choose any provider or facility they prefer without referral or restriction.</li><li>High quality rate: Taiwan has improved the quality and outcomes of health care over time through various initiatives such as accreditation, clinical guidelines, performance evaluation, quality indicators, patient safety, and chronic disease management. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, Taiwan's life expectancy at birth was 80.7 years in 2019, which was higher than the world average of 73.4 years and the OECD average of 80.5 years. Taiwan's infant mortality rate was 3.6 per 1,000 live births in 2019, which was lower than the world average of 28.8 and the OECD average of 3.7.</li><li>Low cost rate: Taiwan has kept its health spending low compared to other countries with similar or higher levels of income and health outcomes. According to the WHO statistics, Taiwan's health expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 6.4 percent in 2018, which was lower than the world average of 9.9 percent and the OECD average of 8.8 percent. Taiwan's health expenditure per capita was US$2,703 in 2018, which was lower than the world average of US$1,139 and the OECD average of US$4,073.</li></ul><p>Despite these achievements, Taiwan's health insurance system also faces some challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. Some of these challenges are:</p><ul><li>Financial sustainability: The NHI system has been running a deficit since 2016 due to rising health care costs, aging population, low premium rates, and generous benefits. The NHIA has taken some measures to increase revenues and reduce expenditures, such as raising premiums, adjusting copayments, implementing global budgets, promoting generic drugs, and enhancing fraud detection. However, these measures may not be sufficient or sustainable in the long run, and may also affect the accessibility and quality of health care. Therefore, the NHIA needs to find more effective and equitable ways to balance the financial situation of the NHI system.</li><li>Health equity: The NHI system aims to provide equal access and benefits to all beneficiaries, regardless of their income, occupation, or location. However, there are still some gaps and disparities in health care utilization and outcomes among different groups of people, such as urban-rural, gender, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. For example, according to a study by Cheng et al., rural residents had lower utilization rates and higher mortality rates than urban residents for some major diseases in Taiwan. The NHIA needs to address these gaps and disparities by improving the distribution and quality of health care resources, enhancing the accessibility and affordability of health care services, and targeting the specific needs and preferences of different groups of people.</li><li>Health innovation: The NHI system encourages health care providers to improve their quality and efficiency through various incentives and regulations. However, the system may also stifle health innovation by imposing rigid fee schedules, payment methods, and benefit packages that do not reflect the value or cost-effectiveness of new technologies or treatments. The NHIA needs to foster a more conducive environment for health innovation by adopting more flexible and dynamic payment mechanisms, evaluating and rewarding the value and outcomes of health care services, and supporting research and development in health care.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Taiwan's health insurance system is a model of universal coverage and cost control that has achieved remarkable results in terms of coverage, access, quality, and cost. However, the system also faces some challenges and limitations that need to be addressed to ensure its financial sustainability, health equity, and health innovation. The NHIA should continue to monitor and evaluate the performance and impact of the NHI system, and to implement appropriate reforms and improvements to meet the changing needs and expectations of its beneficiaries.</p><h6>Taiwan, Health Insurance System, Universal Coverage, Cost Control</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
