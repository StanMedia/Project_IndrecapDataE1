We must build and strengthen our security by seeking to shape the future rather than waiting for the future to shape us," Albanese said.</p><p>The review examined billions of dollars committed by the previous government and reassessed their value against perceived threats, including from an increasingly muscular China under leader Xi Jinping.</p><p>Though the unclassified version of the report didn't include confidential assessments of specific threats, it noted that Australia's largest defense ally, the United States, is "no longer the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific".</p><p>"China's assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia's national interests," the review said.</p><p>The highest level of strategic risk that Australia now faces is the prospect of a major conflict in the region, the review added, suggesting a strategy of greater self-sufficiency combined with stronger relationships with its allies and key powers in the region, including Japan and India.</p><h2>Recasting Australia's defense mission</h2><p>For decades, Australia's remoteness fostered the assumption that any attack would come with a 10-hour warning. Now, countries are able to "project combat power" through assaults on supply routes and cyber warfare, the review said.</p><p>"The rise of the 'missile age' in modern warfare... has radically reduced Australia's geographic benefits (and) the comfort of distance," the report said.</p><p>Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic had exposed Australia's vulnerability to global supply chains, Albanese told reporters, meaning it was necessary for the country to become more self-sufficient.</p><p>"We need to have greater control over our national sovereignty. So not only is manufacturing things in Australia, good for jobs and good for our economy, there's also a national security issue," he said.</p><p>Defense Minister Richard Marles said the defense posture that had served Australia well for decades was "no longer fit for purpose" and the review recasts the mission of the Australian Defence Force (ADF).</p><p>Its new redefined purpose is to defend the nation, project power to its northern approaches, and to maintain the global rules-based order with its allies, Marles said.</p><p>The review recommended Australia adopt a "strategy of denial," defined as "a defensive approach designed to stop an adversary from succeeding in its goal to coerce states through force, or the threatened use of force, to achieve dominance."</p><h2>Boosting Australia's defense capabilities</h2><p>To implement its new defense strategy, Australia plans to invest more than $270 billion over 10 years on new and upgraded capabilities across air, sea and land domains.</p><p>Some of the key initiatives include:</p><ul><li>Acquiring long-range anti-ship missiles and land-attack cruise missiles from US allies</li><li>Developing hypersonic weapons that can travel at least five times faster than sound</li><li>Expanding domestic production of guided weapons and munitions</li><li>Enhancing cyber and space capabilities to deter and respond to attacks</li><li>Increasing surveillance and intelligence assets such as drones and satellites</li><li>Upgrading air combat fleet with more F-35A Joint Strike Fighters</li><li>Building more submarines and surface ships under a $90 billion naval shipbuilding program</li><li>Establishing a new Australian Signals Directorate-led agency to counter foreign interference and disinformation</li></ul><p>The government also pledged to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025-26, up from 2.1% in 2020-21.</p><h2>Australia's role in regional security</h2><p>Australia's new defense plan reflects its growing concern over China's rising influence and assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, where Beijing has been expanding its military presence and activities.</p><p>China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory and has built artificial islands with military facilities on disputed reefs. It has also increased its naval and air patrols near Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.</p><p>Australia has repeatedly expressed its opposition to China's actions in the South China Sea and its support for Taiwan's autonomy and democracy. It has also joined the U.S.-led Quad grouping of countries, along with Japan and India, to enhance security cooperation and coordination in the region.</p><p>However, Australia's stance has provoked China's ire and triggered a series of punitive measures from Beijing, including trade sanctions, diplomatic snubs, and harsh rhetoric. China has accused Australia of being a "lapdog" of the U.S. and interfering in its internal affairs.</p><p>Australia has sought to rebalance its ties with China after a three-year freeze that began under the previous conservative government. It has resumed high-level dialogue with Beijing and toned down its criticism of China's human rights record and Covid-19 response.</p><p>Foreign Minister Wong said Australia was looking to "stabilize" rather than "reset" the relationship with China, acknowledging that there were "deep differences" between the two countries that could not be easily resolved.</p><p>She also said Australia wanted to "lower the heat" on any potential conflict over Taiwan, warning against "frenzied" war speculation in domestic media and political circles. She said Australia's role was to use diplomacy to prevent escalation and support peaceful resolution.</p><p>However, Wong also reaffirmed Australia's commitment to uphold the global rules-based order and defend its national interests and values. She said Australia would not compromise on issues such as sovereignty, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.</p><p>She also said Australia would continue to work closely with its allies and partners in the region, especially the U.S., to deter aggression and coercion from any actor. She said Australia welcomed the U.S.'s renewed engagement and leadership in the Indo-Pacific under President Joe Biden.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Australia's new defense plan marks a significant shift in its strategic outlook and posture in response to China's growing power and assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. It aims to make Australia more self-reliant, more prepared, and more secure in an increasingly uncertain and contested environment.</p><p>The plan also reflects Australia's recognition of the changing balance of power in the region, where the U.S. is no longer the dominant actor and China is challenging the global rules-based order. It seeks to enhance Australia's deterrence and defense capabilities while strengthening its alliances and partnerships.</p><p>However, the plan also poses challenges for Australia's relationship with China, which remains its largest trading partner and a key regional player. While Australia has made efforts to improve its ties with Beijing after a prolonged diplomatic freeze, it still faces deep differences and tensions with China over various issues.</p><p>Australia will need to navigate these challenges carefully and skillfully, balancing its interests and values with pragmatism and diplomacy. It will also need to adapt to the evolving dynamics and uncertainties in the region, where new developments could further inflame or ease the situation.</p><h6>Australia, China, defense, Indo-Pacific</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
