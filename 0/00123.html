"I have been clear: we will not tolerate any form of foreign interference in our internal affairs. Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they engage in this type of behaviour, they will be sent home."</p><p>The news follows weeks of uproar in Canada sparked by revelations, first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service found an accredited Chinese diplomat in the country had targeted opposition lawmaker Michael Chong and his relatives in China following his criticisms of Beijing's treatment of its Uyghur minorities. The intelligence service also said that Beijing had tried to sway the outcome of Canada's federal elections in 2019 and 2021.</p><p>Chong has repeatedly called for Zhao's expulsion since the Globe report emerged. He has also accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government of being too slow to act and failing to brief him on the alleged targeting.</p><p>The allegations have become a growing political problem for Trudeau, who has said that intelligence services failed to brief him on Chong's alleged targeting. He has also faced pressure from other opposition parties and human rights groups to take a tougher stance on China.</p><h2>China denies accusations and expels Canadian diplomat in retaliation</h2><p>Beijing has denied accusations of political interference in Canada. In a statement dated May 5 and posted to the website of the Chinese Consulate in Toronto, a spokesperson flatly rejected the possibility "that a consular officer from the Chinese Consulate General in Toronto was involved in the so-called intimidation of a Canadian Member of Parliament and his relatives."</p><p>"The claim has no factual basis and is totally groundless. We express strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to it," it said, going on to accuse local media and politicians of seeking to "disrupt the normal exchange and cooperation" between Canada and China.</p><p>In response to Canada's expulsion of Zhao, China said it was deploying a "reciprocal countermeasure to Canada's unscrupulous move," which the foreign ministry said it "firmly opposes."</p><p>It said Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, the top Canadian diplomat in the business hub of Shanghai, has been asked to leave by May 13 and that China "reserves the right to take further actions in response."</p><p>The Canadian Embassy in Beijing had no immediate comment on the expulsion order.</p><h2>Background and implications of the diplomatic spat</h2><p>The diplomatic spat is the latest episode in the strained relations between Canada and China, which have deteriorated since the detention of Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou in 2018 and Beijing's subsequent arrest of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on spying charges. All three were freed in 2021 after a deal was reached between the US and China.</p><p>Canada has also joined other Western countries in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang province. China has retaliated with its own sanctions on Canadian lawmakers, officials and entities.</p><p>The expulsion of diplomats could further damage the prospects of dialogue and cooperation between the two countries on issues such as trade, climate change and regional security. It could also increase the risk of further retaliation or escalation from either side.</p><h2>China's alleged attempts to influence Canadian elections</h2><p>According to the CSIS documents obtained by the Globe and Mail, China has been trying to influence Canada's elections since at least 2019, when it allegedly sought to prevent the re-election of the Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer, who had taken a hard line on China.</p><p>The documents said that China used various methods to interfere in Canada's democracy, such as:</p><ul><li>Spreading disinformation and propaganda through social media platforms and Chinese-language media outlets.</li><li>Mobilizing pro-China groups and individuals to participate in rallies, protests and online campaigns.</li><li>Coercing or bribing Canadian politicians, officials, academics, journalists and activists to adopt pro-China positions or refrain from criticizing China.</li><li>Exploiting ethnic ties and business interests to pressure Chinese Canadians to support China's interests or vote for certain candidates.</li><li>Recruiting agents of influence or spies among Canadian elites or vulnerable groups.</li></ul><p>The documents also revealed that China had a specific plan to influence the 2021 federal election, which included:</p><ul><li>Supporting the re-election of Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party, which was seen as more favourable to China than the Conservatives or the New Democrats.</li><li>Targeting several Conservative candidates who had been vocal critics of China's human rights abuses or security threats, such as Michael Chong, Garnett Genuis and Kenny Chiu.</li><li>Trying to sway the outcome of close races in ridings with large Chinese Canadian populations, such as Richmond Centre and Steveston-Richmond East in British Columbia.</li><li>Expanding China's influence network in Canada by cultivating relationships with influential figures, such as former prime minister Jean Chrétien and former ambassador John McCallum.</li></ul><p>The CSIS documents did not provide evidence that China's interference had a significant impact on the election results, which saw the Liberals win a minority government and the Conservatives increase their popular vote share. However, they warned that China's interference posed a serious threat to Canada's sovereignty and national security, and called for more vigilance and countermeasures from the government and the public.</p><h2>China's persecution of overseas free speech activists' relatives in China</h2><p>China has a long history of persecuting the relatives of overseas activists who criticize its policies or expose its human rights violations. The aim is to silence dissent and intimidate critics into submission.</p><p>Some of the methods that China has used to target the relatives of overseas activists include:</p><ul><li>Detaining, interrogating, torturing or imprisoning them on trumped-up charges or without due process.</li><li>Harassing, threatening, blackmailing or extorting them or their employers.</li><li>Confiscating, freezing or transferring their assets or property.</li><li>Banning, restricting or revoking their travel documents or passports.</li><li>Denying, delaying or interfering with their access to health care, education or social services.</li><li>Forcing them to make public confessions or statements denouncing their relatives or praising the Chinese government.</li></ul><p>Some of the cases that illustrate China's persecution of overseas activists' relatives include:</p><ul><li>The case of Geng Xiaonan (耿瀟男), a Chinese publisher and activist who was sentenced to three years in prison in February 2021 for"illegal business operations." Ms. Geng's imprisonment was apparently in retaliation for her outspoken support of those persecuted by the government for exercising their right to freedom of speech and the press. Earlier in July 2020, Ms. Geng had voiced concerns about the detention of Xu Zhangrun (許章潤), then-Tsinghua University professor and an outspoken critic of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.</li><li>The case of Tashpolat Tiyip (塔什波拉提·鐵依甫), a prominent Uyghur scholar and former president of Xinjiang University who was secretly sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve in 2017 for"separatism." Mr. Tiyip's fate remains unknown, and his relatives in China have been harassed and intimidated by the authorities. His brother-in-law, Abduweli Ayup (阿布都外力·阿尤普), a Uyghur linguist and activist who lives in Norway, has been campaigning for his release and exposing China's repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Mr. Ayup said that his sister, Mr. Tiyip's wife, was forced to divorce him and cut off contact with him.</li><li>The case of Gui Minhai (桂民海), a Swedish citizen and Hong Kong-based bookseller who was abducted by Chinese agents in Thailand in 2015 and later appeared on Chinese state television confessing to various crimes. Mr. Gui was sentenced to 10 years in prison in February 2020 for"illegally providing intelligence overseas." Mr. Gui's daughter, Angela Gui (桂安琪), who lives in Britain, has been advocating for her father's release and challenging China's claims about his case. Ms. Gui said that her father's relatives in China have been threatened and coerced by the authorities to pressure her to stop speaking out.</li></ul><h6>China, Canada, diplomacy, interference, expulsion</h6></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=https://indrecap.com/.resource/site.js></script></body></html>
